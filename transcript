[22:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The feeling of the straps being tightned down around my body was a familiar one, paired with the 
sound of the pre flight crew doing it's job to send us up. I look at the panels before me my eyes blazing the familiar trail 
up and down  each lit button the pre flight checklist burned into my memory from the incessant drilling in sims and mock-ups. 
I check the master alarm button for what must be the 20th time in a minute ensuring that it was staying dormant, finally sure 
I close my eyes and take in a deep breath. "I've trained for this all my life it's time to finally live it." I murmur eyes 
still closed. Suddenly I feel the pressure change in my eardrums and hear the helmet lock into place. With another steadying 
breath I open my eyes and look beside me to my fellow cosmonaut and give him a thumbs up. "Engineering and navigation is a go, 
all pre-flight checks out." I say confidently giving him my confident grin.
[22:19] Kire Brownback: 10/4, ambros. Begins to do his checks as well. Fuel: check
Oxy: check
Sensors: nominal.
After flipping switches, pressing a few buttons, his were done as well. Holy fuck it was actually happening. This is Pigeon 3 
commander to ground control. Are we clear for launch?

This is ground control to Pigeon 3. We are clear. T-30 seconds and counting. Good luck

Thank you ground control. Good luck to you as well. Turn to his co-pilot, giving him a nod, before facing out the window, a s
mile of fear, hope, and terror on him
[22:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: With the last preflight done and the nod from Kire I look towards the small circular window to the
sky that was waiting before us and to what waited beyond. Unfortunately  this Saturn 15 rocket was an old hand me down of the 
mar expeditionary era, so there wasn't much room or comfort at all in the design but waiting for us out there was the first 
Faulcon de Lacy Interstellar exploration ship to be built in the Cheshire orbital yards. Unlike this ship it had all the 
modern amenities never before had in space and was quite large nearly 300 meters long and 75 meters wide. However my reverie 
was broken by the crackling comms of ground control in my headset.

"30...29....28..."

The loud clanking of fuel hoses could be heard as they fall away from the rocket the sound causing me to grin fiercely in 
excitement and an equal measure of terror.

"27...26...25...24...23...22...21...20..."

At twenty the sound of the support arms can be heard pulling away from the rocket as  well as the sound of me letting out 
a nervous chuckle.

"I wish they would just launch the damn thing Kire, am I right?"

"19...18...17...16...15...14...13....12...11... 10...9...8...7... 6...5...4...3...2...1..." 

The time had come with a two second free fall we drop from the platform and then with the roar of our boosters and the 
initial slam of G-force our journey had begun.(edited)
[22:42] Kire Brownback: mutters to him self the count down.
20, 19, 18, 17, 16, 15
Ingoring anything ambros might be saying to him, closing his eyes and relaxing
14, 13, 12, 11, 10
Control your breathing. Nothing has gone wrong with rockets for the last 20 years. Surely nothin could go wrong now
9, 8, 7, 6, 5 ignition,
 4, 3, 2, 1 the last second seems to last forever, but then he is pushed into his seat by the g-force
It was happening
They were going to space
[22:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The feeling of being locked into your chair is unlike anything else even in the g force tester
there was no comparison. After a what felt like an eternity the G's finally lessened until finally the feeling of 
weightlessness crept around my body and the ship. Before I could even say a word a loud chirp interrupts me.

"Pigeon 4 this is ground control prepare for comms handover to departure on 223.5 how copy?" 

I look over to Kire and give him a raised eyebrow and on our local comm ask.

"You want to answer that Kire? I'm going to run through the post launch list for our number two engines and prepare us for 1st stage 
separation.... Plus you know you're the pilot and all." 

I say that last part with a chuckle for the past 100 years space flight has nearly all be run remotely or on on auto dock in the case 
of the orbital ferries. However with our Exploration vessel for the first time in a long time Animal kind would be back at the stick 
with the assistance of an on board AI(edited)
[23:00] Kire Brownback: Heh, why not. Ground control this is Pigeon 3, get it right next time, copy well, standing by for com switch 
to 223.5. 

Pigeon 3, once post launch checks are complete,  switch to departures and they will take you from their. Good luck.

Thank you ground control. See y'all.... Well who knows... Good bye. Turns to ambros when checks are done, I'll switch us over
[23:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My gloved paws run of the control boards flipping then un flipping checking and then double checking 
until I was sure everything was in the green. I fold up the post launch checklist then throw it over my shoulder giving a loud 
laugh as it hits the wall and comes back to hit my helmet.

"Now that is going to take some getting used to good thing we have plenty of time to do so.... Kire... I can't believe we made it 
here. After all that training and all those long years of study and work... Well shit look at the stars."
[23:07] Kire Brownback: looks up my god.... Before he forgets, he switches their com channle to 223.5 departures, this is Pigeon 3, 
do you copy?
[23:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "Solid Copy Pigeon 3 we have you on our scopes enjoy the ride and prepare for docking in 20 at Cheshire
Orbital. We will bring you in on auto-dock procedures, how copy?"
[23:13] Kire Brownback: 10/4, departures. Eta for arriveal at docking point 20 is approximately 30 minutes. Will notify when we have 
arrived
[23:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "Copy that enjoy the ride boys. Departure out."

"Well aren't they a talkative bunch." I mused sarcastically

"One thing I can't wait for is having a ship to ourselves with literally the entire solar system as our playground. Top of the line 
systems not to mention two of those new nuclear reactors. No need for worrying about power consumption with those babies."
[23:23] Kire Brownback: True, true. Thank God they are also automated. The amount of maintenance we would have to do on them would 
be insane
[23:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "Nearly everything is automated we just have to make sure that the automation keeps working and if It 
does start to fail... pick up it's slack until we can make it back." 

*I open one of the cargo pockets on my space suit and pull out an older photo one that has the fade and permanent lines of years 
being folded up and opened over and over through out the years. The picture showed the two of us sitting in the cockpit of our jet 
trainer after flying together for the first time. Me in the flight engineers station and you in the pilots seat, the look of 
exhilaration was evident on our faces the flight helmets still on our heads but oxygens masks dangling. I take a long look and float 
it over to you for your appraisal.

"You still remember the first time we flew together? I damn near thought you were going to kill us when you buzzed that orbital
elevator. Good thing I made us go full rich fuel mixture right before it. I do have to say though the way you dodged through those 
support cables still impresses me. I think that's when I knew I wouldn't go to space with any other man.... anyways don't listen to 
me get all sentimental I'm just glad everythings finally paid off."
[23:40] Kire Brownback: Oh good god don't remind me of that moment. You do know I was grounded for 6 months after that
[23:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "Yeah and I was put on maintenance duty for 6 months.... Not the best time ever but hey look at us now... 
The guinea pigs for the most daring mission anyone's ever taken not to mention the top cosmonauts in the entire planet and moon base."
[23:44] Kire Brownback: And also gay! God I hope there isn't any dildos or lube on the ship, or else.... Weeeeelllll.....
[23:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "Well shit I hope there is otherwise I may lose my mind. and well they said it should have every amenity 
that we'd need sooooo.... Dildos too?"
[23:48] Kire Brownback: Did you tell NASA you were gay or not?
[23:50] Ambrosia fluffbutt: "That was a joke right? You think that they would let a couple gay people take their beloved ship out for 
a spin? No I told them I was straight as a laser beam. How about you?"
[23:51] Kire Brownback: .... I think I know why they put us together....
[23:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sneak a peek at you my cheeks slightly flushed with embarrassment. "Welll ughhh I mean We've never done 
anything like that before and they think I'm straight... Did you tell them we were both gay? not that I'm mad or anything."
[23:54] Kire Brownback: No, I told them I'm a gay femboy. Gay as gay could be and plus straight as straight could be MOST LIKLEY 
means no fucking in space
00:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: You can keep those grumbles to yourself Mr.
[00:51] Kire Brownback: No. Grumbles closer to you
[00:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: boops your nose fast to keep the grumbling cat away stay back I say stay back!
[00:52] Kire Brownback: Mew waddles closer to you, smirking
[00:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I bounce to the other side of our space capsule as it continues its journey to the orbiting shipyard. 
stay back!
[00:57] Kire Brownback: jumps over, boop finger at the ready(edited)
[00:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I try to launch myself to the other side but mis judged the jump and end up jumping straight into you.
[01:00] Kire Brownback: catches you and brings you in for a hug
[01:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I accept the hug and stand there with your arms around my waist. Well this is new....
[01:09] Kire Brownback: And we need to get a rainbow flag for our ship
[01:12] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I hug you back briefly and then settle back down into my acceleration chair. We can get the fabricator 
to make one we just can’t have it visible when we report in. 

Hey also sit down we are nearly at the shipyard. I think the auto dock is going to dock us with our ship soon.
[01:16] Kire Brownback: Whiiiiiiiich is why we won't be doing the reports in our room
[01:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Our room?” I thought we had separate bunking stations.... I shrug and check the engineering read outs 
as we hurtle through space towards our awaiting ship.(edited)
[01:18] Kire Brownback: shrugs I don't really care..... Though I may sneak into your room and cuddle with you in your sleep if 
I'm cold
[01:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod just like solitary confinement training those were some long months...
[01:21] Kire Brownback: shudders it was terrible for me.... My fur doesn't keep me as warm as it should
[10:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sidle up next to the cat and give him a warm hug and a friendly smile. Well if you need to I guess 
you could use me as your heater. 

just then the module makes a sudden jarring thud and we can hear the air locks latch as our small craft docks with our new home. 
That was pretty damn fast well Kire are you reading to make history?
[11:00] Kire Brownback: Yes... Thinking [holy fuck holy Fuck holy fuck]
[11:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: * I step away from you as the hatch opens up to a bright white and very spacious interior. 
In contrast to the old module we used to get here everything screamed cutting edge tech. I walk through the hatch looking back 
at you with a nervous smile. And then take a look around. There was not a soul onboard. Instead a clear soft female voice could be 
heard all around us.* “Hello gentlemen I’m AVA your artificial vehicle assistant, are you ready to begin your journey? I took the 
liberty of prepping the engines and detaching all docking couplers say the word and we will start heading towards the horse head 
nebula.”

I look around surprised and look back at you.

“I was kinda expecting like a welcoming party but I’m kinda glad it’s just us. Do you want to let the ship take us out while we 
get settled in?”
[11:10] Kire Brownback: jumps in behind you yeah let's. Good to meet you AVA. Jumps around as he explores the ship
[11:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I follow behind you amused at your jumping around. Once we hit the crew quarters and the dirt opened 
up I let out a long hmmmm.

So ummm why is there only one room and one bed? I say my cheeks getting a little red and hot.
[11:16] Kire Brownback: shrugs don't know. You think we left the old ask AVA for a new bed? Jumps in to the room and begins looking 
around
[11:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my face gets a little redder and I look away from you and mumble I mean I don’t mind sharing a bed with 
you.... but if you mind I could ask her...
[11:20] Kire Brownback: No, I don't mind at all leaves the bedroom and goes to the cocpit
[11:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I follow you into the cockpit and the view is breathtaking instead of ships of the past this ship had a 
full panoramic viewing window that went from ceiling to floor on the left side was the pilots station and on the right was the flight 
engineers station. I go down to sit into my seat and bring up the diagnostic panels on the reactor cores gain and heat as well as 
coolant levels and the operational status of the ion drives. “everything is at optimal performance levels Kire.”
[11:30] Kire Brownback: Good, good goes and sits at his seat, a holographic display of other obsticals in the ships path, along with 
analog joy sticks and button to actually control the ship

AVA Kire, I shall be controlling the ship for the majority of the time, but you may take control at any moment.

Kire thank you AVA. Also, is it possible you could add a rainbow flag and a second bed to our quarters?

AVA I have added the flag as you requested, but I can not add another bed due to safety concerns. I am sorry, Kire
[11:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I raise an eyebrow and give you an interesting look safety concerns? That’s a new one... and also nice 
touch with the flag.
[11:38] Kire Brownback: Thanks. And I think she might be saying that there isn't enough room in there(edited)
[11:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Yeah I guess that makes sense. I look around and check the holographic displays one more time then shut 
them off. Well everything is working perfectly I’m going to head to....our room and change into something more comfortable.

Hey Eva turn gravity to about 40% earth norm.

“Complying with you request”

After a few seconds there was a definite downward drag allowing us to walk instead of float but still allowing us to jump and glide 
through the air at will.
[11:45] Kire Brownback: gets off of his chair and follows him mind if I change with you?
[11:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug as I walk to our room and hold the door open for you. Not at all might as well get used to it.
[11:50] Kire Brownback: Yep. Walks in to the room thanks for holding the door for me begins striping out of his old uniform
[11:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I begin stripping politely looking away from your body but after I get out of my jumpsuit something makes 
me turn around. I can see your well toned back and ass and it makes my mouth slightly water... after a brief mental debate I finally 
say fuck it and walk up behind you and giving you a naked hug my hands wrapping around your waist while one slowly descends to cup your 
sheath. My breathing is fast in your ear but I don’t dare say a word. Compared to the takeoff from earth this was much more terrifying
[11:58] Kire Brownback: blushes hard when he cups his sheath well.... I'm guessing you want to have some fun*
[12:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I don’t answer with words instead I press myself against your ass softly my hard length pressing in between 
your supple cheeks while my paw gently massages your sheath.
[12:03] Kire Brownback: blushes harder, his member beginning to rise out of it's sheath
[12:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I feel the tip of you member and then delicately begin to rub just the tip between my fingers slowly teasing
it. My own length getting harder on your back.
[10:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sidle up next to the cat and give him a warm hug and a friendly smile. Well if you need to I guess you
could use me as your heater.

[00:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My fingers relax on your tip and my paw gently takes your shaft into a full grip. I begin to slowly stroke 
making sure to add just a bit of a twisting motion when it gets to your tip trying to stimulate the sensitive head.
[00:47] Kire Brownback: moans, a drop of pre starting to form as he thrusts into your paw your nimble with your paws(edited)
[00:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Well I do have quite a bit of practice. I say as I gently squeeze the tip gathering your pre then stroking 
down trying to lubricate your shaft.
[00:51] Kire Brownback: moans, pulling you closer with his tail should we move to the bed?
[00:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I murmur out a husky Yus... I jump onto the bed and land in an all fours position looking behind at you 
with a cheeky grin waggling my exposed ass tail lifted to give a full view. Have you ever thought about getting into this ass before?
I say waggling my eyebrows at you
[00:56] Kire Brownback: giggles oh, I can see your a horny otter gets up behind you the safe word is Elon begins to prod your entrance 
with his tip
[00:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grunt a pull my hips forward. Nuh uh you better get some lube or use that tongue of yours but you're not 
forcing yourself into this hole.
[00:59] Kire Brownback: Sorry, hun spits in to his paw and strokes his cock for a couple of seconds I'll ask AVA for some lube later. 
With his member lubed up to the best of his ability, he begins to poke his way in
[01:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I close my eyes and let out a soft moan as I feel you lined up with my tailhole. As I feel the pressure 
build I relax as well I can and push back feeling your head slide in causing me to clench in surprise. Oh fuck... mmmm it's been awhile.
[01:03] Kire Brownback: moans in relief as well, bending over slightly to make it more comfortable on his end and he slowly starts to 
thrust in and out, pushing a tiny bit farther into you with each thrust
[01:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: As I feel you start to thrust into me I gently push back against each thrust until you are fully inside me 
my walls clenching hard when you fully bury yourself in me.
[01:08] Kire Brownback: Ffuuck your tight.... Keeps thrusting in and out m-mind if I fill you up?
[01:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: MMmmm I'd be offended if you didn't... My shaft is now bobbing with each of your thrusts in pre dripping 
onto the covers of the bed in a long drooling strand.
[01:13] Kire Brownback: a very slight throb begins to form j-just polite his thrusts are noticably faster now, almost coming all the
way in and out each time
[01:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: * I feel the gentle throbbing of your cock and press back harder against you matching your pace the wet 
sound of your balls slapping into mine can start to be heard as you thrust away. I can feel you getting close... we might have to do 
this often to build up your endurance kitty cat. I say this between moans and trying to be flirty through the gasps and squeeks.
[01:20] Kire Brownback: H-heh... Y-yeah.... I'm b-better at sleeping th-then fucking, I'd say *the throbbing is now visiable from the 
out side. With one final moan and thrust down to the base of his cock, his sperm escape, filling up the cute otter boys ass
[01:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I close my eyes as I fell you hilt yourself inside me and then feel the first hard throb and the feeling 
of hot warmth as you start to fill me. Ohhhhhh yeeeeessssss I let out with a pleasurable his my ass clenching trying to milk more of 
the delightful warmth out of you.
[01:25] Kire Brownback: lays down on you back, moan with each string of cum s-sorry if I cruch you tries to thrust ever so slightly, 
but is make his whole body shudder as he does
[01:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I thrust back at your small thrust enjoying the warmth being pushed further inside. No problem dear.
[01:28] Kire Brownback: holds you close as he falls down onto his back, hugging you tight
[01:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I gently guide us so we are laying on our sides making sure not to let you slip out from me. I take my paw 
and search behind me till I find one of yours and gently guide it to my rock hard cock still wet from the enormous amount of pre created by our first time.
[01:33] Kire Brownback: Damn... How long has it been since you were last fucked.... Begins to move his paw up and down slowlyz giving 
you neck very gentle and light kisses
[01:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I close my eyes and let out a soft sigh as I feel your hand run down my smooth shaft
[01:38] Kire Brownback: begins stroking your member a bit faster, wrapping his paw around it
23:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I bite my bottom lip as your paw engulfs my member, the soft fur tickling me in an oh so pleasurable way as 
your ministrations become slightly faster. "Mmmmm your so very good at this Kire... ohhh..ah." my last words coming out as a shuddering 
moan as my pre starts to leak onto your paw.
[23:24] Kire Brownback: strokes a bit faster, using your precum as lubricant. Hehe, thanks, Hun kisses your head lightly
[23:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft mewl of pleasure at your kiss and bring my paw to your head lightly petting your soft fur 
behind your ears. "Such a good kitty..." I whisper, my dick now fully erect and pulsing softly in your grip.
[23:27] Kire Brownback: purrs, the vibrations going thourght my paw and on to your cock as he squeezes it lighty
[23:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My eyes open widely as your vibrations hit my cock and I let out a grunt of surprise. "That's something new!"
I nearly yelp out my petting going lower and lower until I reach your cock and gently massage it.
[23:32] Kire Brownback: purrs, his member starting to rise from sheath at your touch as his pumps only get faster and faster
[23:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I close my eyes and my hips start to thrust back against your pumps my hand still gently messing the fur of 
your sheath and gently teasing the head peeking out.
23:44] Kire Brownback: his tip poke at your fur lighty, wanting to get by as Kire kisses ambro passionately
[23:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I feel the heat in your kiss and after a few long moments I pull away then give you a wink as I move my 
head to your sheath giving your tip a few gentle licks(edited)
[23:47] Kire Brownback: moans, his member rising quickly f-f-fuck you can hold out long(edited)
[23:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give a slight laugh "Oh honey hands just don't do it for me... and yeah it takes a long while for me"
[23:55] Kire Brownback: Oh~ goes down and licks toyishly at his member with his tounge
00:15] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my cock twitches when your tongue teases my tip my lips finding your emerging cock and taking it delicately 
into my mouth gently using my tongue to rub and stimulate your underside.
[00:16] Kire Brownback: moans into your cock as he begins to suck on it, licking it with his tounge lightly(edited)
[00:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a moan into your shaft and begin to lightly bob on it
[00:31] Kire Brownback: moans, his member fully erect now. He Bob's up and down on your cock, moving a paw down your genitals and 
playing with your balls lighty
[00:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A paw goes to your head and gently presses down on the back of your neck encouragingly as I loudly moan 
into your cock my pace growing quite rapid as I bob up and down on about half of your length.
[00:35] Kire Brownback: goes a bit faster, matching your pace and amount
00:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock twitches and I pull of your dick a whimper out "Kire ohhh gods im going to cum."
[00:42] Kire Brownback: smirks, going faster and deeper while he lightly plays with your balls(edited)
[00:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My whole body shudders and I grab your shoulder as I let out a feminine moan my shaft throbbing before 
shooting thick spurts of cum into your mouth. My orgasm continues for several seconds each spurt getting smaller and smaller until
my cock is just left twitching and throbbing. An expression of sheer unadulterated bliss on my face.
[00:49] Kire Brownback: drinks down you semen happily, only a few drops seeping out the side of his mouth. When he's done cumming, 
he come off of his cock and pulls him in for a passionate kiss
[00:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: at first I don’t kiss back I’m so locked in my bliss but after a long moment my lips greet yours happily 
my tail wrapping around with yours my paw resuming its grip on your cock but slowing to a comfortable slow pace trying to keep you 
pleasured but not over stimulated “That was so lovely Kire.... mmmm I’m glad we will be sharing this bed for a long time.... my body
will always be open for you. You never need to ask permission...” I pant huskily into your mouth every few words punctuated by a soft
lick or subtle kiss.
[00:55] Kire Brownback: Good to know.... And moves you paw off of my member you don't have to finish if you wan a sleep. I have a few 
things I need to do
[00:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I know I don’t have to.... but I WANT too.” O say with emphasis on the want.
[00:57] Kire Brownback: Well then lays down do what you want with my member
[00:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give you a tender before I lick the tip then suddenly take you all the way to the base quickly your tip 
entering into my throat as@I hold you there
[00:59] Kire Brownback: moans loudly, his member twitching as pre begins to flow out
[01:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My drool pools around your cock slowly flowing down to your balls. “I hold this position for at least two 
minutes occasionally swallowing around your twitching shaft before I pull off gasping. “cough cough I’m glad.... all that breath 
training.... ahh has practical uses.” I sputter out with a wink as I position my self above your shaft my knees bending so that your 
now saliva covered shaft is kissing the entrance to my tail hole.
[01:05] Kire Brownback: moans heavily when you come off of me
[01:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give you a soft smile and watch your face closely as I very slowly descend on your shaft letting out a 
girly moan as you enter me my face growing pink with a blush. I descend slowly inch by tantalizing inch until your buried fully in me 
“mmmmm welcome back to your home space port.”
[01:10] Kire Brownback: closes his eyes as you descend, more pre cumming out, a barrage of semen exits, filling up his internal station
with strings of it as he moans loudly, though the strings get smaller each time, eventually stopping completely(edited)
[01:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft moan as I feel you cum inside of me. And while you cum I gently ride you trying to milk 
you and let you ride out your orgasm. I stay on top of you for a few long moments before rising up and off careful to clench tightly
not wanting to let your cum slip out of me
[01:14] Kire Brownback: need a plug, Hun?
[01:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It would be handy my lovely kitty. I love having a part of you inside me.”
[01:18] Kire Brownback: nods, then looks at the Celine AVA, can you create a butt plug for Ambrose? A few moments pass and then medium 
size but plug appears on ambrose's side of the bed I'll lube it up for you, if you want, Hun
[01:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I think you gave me plenty inside of me maybe...” I do roll over though and use my hands to part my cheeks
giving you a clear view of my cum covered tailhole still flexing and winking begging to be filled.
[01:23] Kire Brownback: (oh yeah, I forgot you could fit a universe in an otter ass) hehe, should I start my own collecting of your cum? He says while he grabs the but plug and licks all around it then begins to push it in slowly
[01:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Mmmm that would be fucking hot baby... ohhhh!” My cock jumps and spurts as buttplug slowly presses on my 
sensitive prostate causing me to prematurely cum.
[01:27] Kire Brownback: seeing it jumps up, he puts his mouth on it and swallows the cum, then presses the plug in the rest of the way
[01:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My hips thrust back as you finish sliding in the plug. I turn around quickly and kiss your cum covered lips
my tongue cleaning up the few wet spots where my cum leaked out “I wish you didn’t have to do something.... I could be fucked by you 
forever.... it is true that otters are pretty much nymphos.... I hope you know what your in for.” I flirtingly joke.
[01:34] Kire Brownback: Hun, we both have stuff to do remember. We have research to do. I just have a few things I need to set up and 
create a few custume functions kisses him
[01:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: * I sigh and kiss you back getting up and stretching* “yeah I need to launch reactor core diagnostics as 
well.” Just then a smirk comes to my face and I grab the tablet on my end table and head to the reactors.... naked with cum still 
coating my ass(edited)
[01:38] Kire Brownback: sighs and yells over to him take a shower before you go in there! Gets up and goes to his desk, beginning work 
on stuff
[01:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: you hear me laughing already halfway down he hallway. “I’ll use the chemical shower! I gotta check it 
anyways’”
[01:41] Kire Brownback: sighs, putting on "hooked on a feeling" as he works
[01:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: After about 4 hours I finally return back to our room my face showing a tired grimace as I still type into 
the tablet my report. Without looking up I murmur. “what have you been up to? Did you get forced to take a 3 hour tour of your areas 
by AVA?”
[01:46] Kire Brownback: Only at the begging. Thank God I have the master over ride. Also I made a few functions for us butWhen you can, 
do a soft restart of your talblet and you see them appear. I bet you like them*
[01:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and start typing faster after another few minutes and a grunt I stop and restart the tablet. While 
it reboots I look over at you. “So what are these functions?”(edited)
[01:52] Kire Brownback: So, there is a new menu to the left of control that has all of the new functions. I added a lube on demand 
button, which can be custum tailored to your lube preference, condom creator, which I doubt will have much use for since we got the 
STD immunizations, both of which have voice commands.
[01:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and give you a quick smile. “That’s a pretty damn good Idea.”
[01:55] Kire Brownback: And if you flip to the menu next to it, you see the Sex Toy Storage Sector, my personal favorite
[01:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my ears perk up at this “This sounds even better!”
[01:59] Kire Brownback: Hehe, yep. It keeps track of all toys we have so we don't accidentally create to many, and we can set a limit 
for each individual toy. I did try to create a voice command for this one, but I didn't think it would work very well
[02:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah to many variations and different types.” As we talk I lay down on the bed on my chest coyly my tail 
moves slightly out of the way exposing the plug still in my ass.
[02:02] Kire Brownback: giggles see you still have the plug in you
[02:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I turn back and give you a flirty wink. “Mmmhmmm...”
[02:06] Kire Brownback: Oh! AVA, rememind me to work on the wireless toy tool

AVA reminder set. Next time you activate your computer I will remind you.

Kire thank you, AVA
[02:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “That will be a barrel of fun.” I say before pulling out the plug. When I do nothing comes out me being the 
hygienic otter that I am I cleaned myself and reinserted the plug.
[02:10] Kire Brownback: sighs and sits down next to you(edited)
[02:12] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “What’s wrong Love?” I ask taking your hand in mine.
[02:13] Kire Brownback: Nothing, Hun. Just relaxing after a decent amount of work*
[02:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and browse through the Toy menu curiously my face getting redder and redder each tab I scroll through.
[02:15] Kire Brownback: looks at your table and smirk looking for some fun, Hun? Trust me, there will be a lot more tommorow
[02:19] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m always looking for some fun in fact....”

“EVA turn off artificial gravity in this room.”

“Artificial Gravity now at 20% might I advise that zero gravity makes sexual intercourse extremely challenging as found by the NASA 
study circa 1998”
[02:22] Kire Brownback: blinks rapidly AVA, why are you watching us fuck?
[02:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: after a long pause AVA answers “To better learn your personalities and daily routine to better anticipate 
your requests.”
[02:25] Kire Brownback: ....ok that doesn't actually seem that bad, then
[02:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah it’s not like she’d get off on it Kire she’s artificial after all, Lube EVA”
[02:28] Kire Brownback: a bottle of cumlube appears next to ambros
[02:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A take the bottle and pour a generous amount on my tailhole. After that I place it back and slowly work a 
finger into it gently.
[02:31] Kire Brownback: watches him as he does need some help, hun?
[02:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a quiet moan as I slowly insert another finger. Before pulling them both out. “Mmmm if you want 
to dear.”
[02:33] Kire Brownback: I might.... Though I do also wanna work on that wireless toy tool

AVA you have a remind-

Kire shut up, AVA
[02:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give a soft giggle. “Jeez Kire don’t get to mad you did ask her to remind you.”
[02:36] Kire Brownback: sighs true, true gets up and grabs his table, then begins drafting out how he wants it to function and work
[02:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I frown then shrug moving my fingers back to my tailhole and slowly working two fingers into me.
[02:39] Kire Brownback: looks over can you pass me the lube, please?(edited)
[02:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I toss the lube over to you the 20% gravity letting it gently float over to you in a soft arch
[02:41] Kire Brownback: grabs it with his tail and sets in down, then stick a bit of his tail in and pokes your fingers, trying to get 
his tail in
[02:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I raise an eyebrow then move my fingers out of the way intrigued “This is new.”
[02:44] Kire Brownback: I'm quite agil with my tail slowly poke his way in
[02:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My mouth opens as I feel the soft fur of your tail slowly enter me. “Mmmm slender bit soft.... very ahhh
new....”
00:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock twitches and I pull of your dick a whimper out "Kire ohhh gods im going to cum."
[00:42] Kire Brownback: smirks, going faster and deeper while he lightly plays with your balls(edited)
[00:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My whole body shudders and I grab your shoulder as I let out a feminine moan my shaft throbbing before 
shooting thick spurts of cum into your mouth. My orgasm continues for several seconds each spurt getting smaller and smaller until my 
cock is just left twitching and throbbing. An expression of sheer unadulterated bliss on my face.

[02:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My mouth opens as I feel the soft fur of your tail slowly enter me. “Mmmm slender bit soft.... very ahhh new....”
[20:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “How does it feel?” I say my hips firmly planted in top of you. A free paw traces a claw gently down your spine to your ass before giving it a pinch.(edited)
[20:45] Kire Brownback: he gasps and shudders slightly, blinking a bit, trying not to clench on your member f-fuck.. he pants softly, groaning~
[20:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft chuckle and lean over you causing my dick to teasingly slowly pullout of you to the tip. “You feel so amazing Kire.... I honestly never expected us to ever.....” I stop whispering in your ear and give your neck a gentle nip as I suddenly thrust myself fully into you again and slowly start to build a rhythm. “Mmmmhhmmm, soooo good.”
[20:55] Kire Brownback: moans softly with each thrust, closing his eyes and embracing you y-yes~ m-more, Ambrose.. clenches more on his cock, rubbing your back slowly j-just like th-that~
[20:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock throbs when you clench around me and I let out a long low moan. The feeling of your hands on my back and your panting words spur my hips faster and faster. A quiet pat pat pat filling the air with our moans and gasps. “K-Kire you feel~ ahhh~ so good.”
[21:04] Kire Brownback: he kisses you deeply, gulping and closing his eyes g-god your so good. His tounge is hanging out of his mouth, drooling onto his fur b-break me~
[21:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I don’t say a word but after I hear your words my next thrust slams into your ass hard my hips quickly pushing in and out faster and faster until I can’t go any faster. “Fuck.... uffff.” I grunt hard panting as I pound you
[21:11] Kire Brownback: moans loudly y-yES!~ clenches hard on his cock, panting heavily
[21:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I throw back my head as I pound into you letting out an instinctive growl. My free paw going down to firmly grab your hard cock. My paw rubs over the top collecting pre as lube before starting to stroke you fast.(edited)
[21:16] Kire Brownback: his cock begins to throb from all of the stimuli, having already being close to cumming due to his thrusts, making him drip a large amount of pre
[21:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My hips pick up an animal pace while my hand stroke harder and faster. My eyes closed tight as I groan loudly. “Oh fuck..... I~I’m going to ..... Arggghhhh!” As I try to finish my words my cocks begins to throb hard and I slam hard into you as deep as I can. My first spurts deep inside of you followed by more and more of my hot load. “Oooooooohhhh Fuck.”
[21:23] Kire Brownback: he moans louder then before, shooting multiple strings of cum, covering his body in cum, managing to catch a couple string in his mouth
[21:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I rest  still inside of you for a moment before pulling out of you my cock pulling away with a thick strand of cum still connecting us together. I give you a wink before going to the bedside table and grabbing the large hot pink egg shaped buttplug.
[21:27] Kire Brownback: he clenches as you pull out, making sure to let barely any cum drip out, still panting heavily
[21:29] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I lay the plug right underneath your tailhole and move it so it rest gently against your entrance.(edited)
[21:30] Kire Brownback: he gulps and relaxes his hole a bit, closing his eyes and slowing his breaths r-ready
[21:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The large tip slowly presses against your hole gently stretching it as it slowly enters you.
[21:33] Kire Brownback: groans softly, relaxing more and more as he gets stretched by it, his breath slowly speeding up
[21:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I keep inserting it till it gets to its widest point about 3 inches wide and then it slips in easily with gentle push “How does that feel hot stuff.”
[21:39] Kire Brownback: he had closed his eyes, but opens then when he hears your voice, he opens his eyes b-bettee then ever he slowly sits up and rubs at the base of the egg very softly
[21:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I lean over you and give your lips a soft peck. “I think we both need a shower.” I chuckle out with a playful grimace. “We smell like really really good sex.”
[21:45] Kire Brownback: giggles yeah, its true.. sits up and then looks back and forth c-could you take me there? My legs are a bit sore right now...
[21:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: smiles at you and then gently put my arms underneath your knees and back and gently kick off from the bed the 20% gravity let us drift from the bed and into the hallway towards the showers “Have you checked out these showers yet?”
[21:50] Kire Brownback: he shakes his head, still looking up at him, blushing very lightly no... H-how are they?
[21:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nuzzle your red tinted cheeks lightly before answering. “360 degree water jets very interesting.”
[21:55] Kire Brownback: he tiles his head really? Like.. everywhere? Above you, below you, and arround you?
[21:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “yup”
[22:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: we enter the shower room and where one would expect to find stalls and shower heads instead the room was empty with a large sphere floating in the middle of the room. As soon as we enter the rooms threshold the telltale weight of the artificial gravity leaves us. “Welcome to the shower.” I say as we reach the large white sphere I use my tail to hit a small button that makes a doorway slide open that was almost imperceptible before. I gently push you inside and follow after you. “AVA activate shower moderate heat low jet please.” The water activates and in an instant it’s like we are being enveloped by rain but from everywhere. Where the water droplets land they get absorbed and all waste matter removed before being launched again at us,making it almost nearly 100% efficient.
[22:07] Kire Brownback: he gasps and imediatly relaxes, almost floating out of his grip as he gets in veloped in the spray, getting cleaned in parts he didn't know he had w-wow....
[22:12] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah it’s pretty nice.” I close my eyes  and enjoy the spray and hold you closer my chest. “you’re a cutie you know.”
[22:16] Kire Brownback: he blushes heavily, wiggling a bit th-thanks...
[22:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give you a wink and rest my hand on your ass my fingers reaching between your cheeks and gently press against the base of the plug
[22:29] Kire Brownback: he gasps and looks back at him p-please d-dont....
[22:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give you a playfully evil look and give it a gentle twist before shrugging. “Alright fine...” I begin to groom your face slowly and meticulously using my tongue to clean up any remaining traces of your cum and sweat.
[22:41] Kire Brownback: purrs softly, closing his eyes and nearly falling asleep
[22:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I move from your face down to your neck and then gently raise your arms one by one taking careful attention to groom every part of you. “You know I could get used to Th—————-“ 

Suddenly an immensely loud droning alarm starts to off it’s like an air raid siren but instead of piercing your eardrums it vibrates your whole being
AVA “Core 1 containment  variance detected condition one is set throughout the ship.”
[22:49] Kire Brownback: he gasps, his ears perking up to full attention AVA, lockdown sector.. 4, full. Shower room dry, full. Prepare radiation suits 1 and 2 he wiggles himself out of the otters grip(edited)
[22:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let go of you and immediately slam my hand on the door release. Before the full drying cycle is even complete. I use my muscular tail to propel me through the opening and out the shower rooms door calling out behind me. “I need you at the helm now! If the gain has lowered too much you’ll need to correct for the number 2 engines lack of thrust.” By the time I’m done talking I’m already half way into one of the snug helmeted radiation suit and heading towards the reactor.
[22:56] Kire Brownback: he nods and propels him self after him and putting on a com headset check 1, 2. Can you hear me? He sits down and brings up his display, the recording of all measurements having started automatically
[23:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: a faint static crackle can be heard in your ear in then my voice can be heard clearly all playfulness gone and replaced by dead seriousness.

“You’re coming in clear I’m entering the reactor chamber now. From first glance all reading seems within safe parameters I see no spike in radiation levels right now.”
[23:04] Kire Brownback: Copy that, same readings hear. Presses a few things appears the breach is in 4-5.4. tools located in entrance door. We may lose communication.
[23:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m reaching there now I have the tool box.” * I use an X-ray scanner in search of a breach but nothing shows up. I check the Geiger built into the Heads up display and it shows nothing* “Hey Kire can you read me? I’ve got nothing there’s no sign of a containment leak all stats are normal can you try to manually reset all sensors in the reactor room it’ll need your priority override.”
[23:12] Kire Brownback: 10/4 turns off his com mic and prepares for it, turning his com mic back on eta of full sensor restart is 5 seconds, stand by for restart
[23:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m ready while the sensors restart I’ll manually control reactor 1 settings”
[23:15] Kire Brownback: he nods restart in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 *press the GO button casueing the lights to flicker:
AVA: attention, full sensor restart is in eff- full sensor restart is complete. All sensors online.
[23:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Immediately the alarms stop and the red emergency lights turn off 

EVA “Reactor systems running at optimal performance I will log this sensor malfunction and try to prevent further false alarms from happening in the future.”
[23:26] Kire Brownback: he nods and sighs undstood. End com logs. Presses a button alright, we're all clear
[23:28] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Understood I’m going to put the suit back and run some minor diagnostics of my own... no offense EVA.”

EVA “None taken.”
[23:30] Kire Brownback: he chukles command off com he takes of his head set and leans back, stretching
[23:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I spend the next 3 hours checking every single connection to every sensor eventually I find one with not quite enough soldering to the main chipset. After re soldering it and reconnecting it I put up my tools and head to the kitchen area.
[23:35] Kire Brownback: kire has fallen asleep on the couch, curled up into a tight ball
[23:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: after grabbing a quick snack I come back into our living quarters and see you resting on the couch I can’t help but smile to see you there curled up peacefully. I quietly paid over to you and gently spoon you trying my best not to wake you up.
[23:44] Kire Brownback: he doesn't even twitch. His breaths are slow and even
[23:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I close my eyes and just relax simply listening to your even deep breaths. Before I realize it I’m falling asleep with you.
09:45] Kire Brownback: he yawns softly, beginning to purr as he feels the otter spooning him, not moving much since he doesnt want to disturb him
[10:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The slight vibration of the purring cat makes me shift and drape an arm around you.
12:34] Kire Brownback: he yawns again, trapped here until the otter wakes up, or leaves
[12:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I squeeze you you gently and open one eye yawning out a lazy “Mornin...” yawns again “we got any coffee?”
[12:42] Kire Brownback: he smiles and nuzzles your head softly mmm.. ask ava
[13:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “AVA coffee now... please.” I say mumbling as if I’m barely alive
[15:13] Kire Brownback: a coffee plops down on the the next to them
[21:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grab the steaming cup and sit up taking a long drag from it. “God this is terrible coffee...”
[21:57] Kire Brownback: yawns and sits up as well, leaning against Ambrose AVA, set a pot out on the stove with some tea bags
[21:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take another long sip and then grab my tablet which is laying on the table. “So what’s on our docket today?”
[22:00] Kire Brownback: grabs his as well we have to make our first report of what has happened, and then do an outside and inside inspection of both engines cells. He frowns that's dangerous
[22:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Hmmm not to bad I’ve got over 1000 hours logged for spacewalks. Suits kinda uncomfortable though.”
[22:10] Kire Brownback: he nods that's good. He stands up and starts to head to the kitchen according to my estimates, the inspection is going to take at least, 2 hours. 1 hour interior, starts to fill the pot up with water 1 hour exterior
[22:12] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Not to mention the power down procedures” I get up from the couch and head towards the kitchen as well. I head towards the repli mat and type in a few things into the control panel until the door closes and reopens with a muffin in the food bay.
[22:14] Kire Brownback: he sighs true, true puts the pot on the stove, puts the tea bags in the pot, and then turns the stove on to high do you like tea?
[22:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I do enjoy tea just not first thing in the morning.” I say this while taking the muffin to the table. I sit down and take a bite of the steamy blueberry muffin.
[22:18] Kire Brownback: he nods got it presses some buttons on his tablet, walking towards the cockpit
[22:19] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Heading somewhere?” I ask while looking up from my tablet and taking a nice long look.
[22:20] Kire Brownback: sits down in his chair just getting a print out of the data from the "emergency" yesterday so I can analyze them
[23:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod in understanding finishing the rest of my coffee quickly and standing up to follow behind you muffin in hand “I sent you the pictures of the defect.”
[23:38] Kire Brownback: nods got it. Presses a button, papers starting to fall onto the ground next to him in a neat pile
[23:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “what’s all that?” I ask pointing to the papers.(edited)
[23:42] Kire Brownback: Graphs and stuffs. He collects them and puts all of the papers into a filling cabnit
[23:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug and start to type into my tablet quickly. “I’m beginning the engine shutdown procedures full shut down will take approximately an hour and a half. What’s our current trajectory and inertia? I want to make sure we won’t need engine power to pull away from any gravity wells.”
[23:47] Kire Brownback: he pulls up a 3-d map and begins to write some notes we have 2 hours until we need to do a manuver, so we got a good amount of time
[23:50] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I pause typing and look up. “We might need to wait then with the hour and a half it takes to shut them down and two hours for the inspection we won’t have enough time.”
[23:51] Kire Brownback: he frowns I thought it was only an hour for the inspection?
[23:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I thought you said interior and exterior that’ll take an hour each I’m good but not that good.” I say putting my tablet to the side.
[23:55] Kire Brownback: he nods ok walks back to the tea and turns off the stove since it was starting to boil over the edge, talking to himself as he works
6 October 2018
[00:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I cancel the shut down procedures and turn off my tablet. “soooo we got some time to kill then.... what do you want to do?”
[00:04] Kire Brownback: he pours the thing of pot tea into a pitcher gonna mess arround in engineering, probably
[00:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Alright I’ll bring up the nonessential inspection list we can knock that out before we tackle the engines . By the time we finish that it should be about time for the course correction then we can tackle the engines.” I give a self affirming nod to myself and then take a big bite from my muffin. “Should be fun.”
[00:10] Kire Brownback: he nods and then puts the pitcher in the fridge ok, but we also need to make our first report sometime today
[00:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yessir.” I say heading to the living compartment to get changed into my engineering coveralls
[00:15] Kire Brownback: Get my uniform while your in there he yells to him while setting up the camera
[00:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I come out in the royal blue of the maintenance coveralls carrying your white pilots uniform with me. “Here ya go Kire.”
[00:23] Kire Brownback: smiles and puts them on quickly thank you there is a blue X and a white X in front of the camera you stand there points to the blue mark and I'll stand here. I'll address the issue we had yesterday and you can explain what happened
[00:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I move to stand on the blue X and do a last minute inspection of my uniform before standing at attention. “Ready.”
[00:32] Kire Brownback: he gets into the same position as him, them presses a button behind his back
A red light flashes on the camera, signalling that it has begun recording good morning, control. Hope you are all doing wonderful. Me and Ambrose have been having a wonderful time up here he blushes the slightest bit but that hasn't come without incident. Yesterday, right before me and him headed off to sleep, we had an alarm go off that directed to us sector 4-5.4, which is in the main reactor. Ambrose will talk about the details of the events
[00:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I wait patiently for you to finish and then relax my posture a little before talking. “As Kire said we had an alarm activation yesterday, the alarm in question was the containment breech alarm, after investigating any possible source of leak we found no evidence to lead us to believe there was ever any leak to begin with. Seeing that all ambient radiation and temperature levels inside the sector where within norms we decided sensor reset was necessary. After we reset the sensors the alarm deactivated leading me to believe this was a sensor defect. I inspected each of the 112 sensors until I found one that was missing a significant amount soldering causing the short that tripped the alarm this issue has since been remedied.”
[00:40] Kire Brownback: he nods at Ambrose when you receive this message, you will be getting a small amount of papers as well. This is a record of graphs of all sensors at the time, along with a picture of the sensor in question.
[00:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “We will be following the scheduled inspection of the engines later today and will keep you informed of any other abnormalities that we may come across. Chief of engineering Ambrose signing off.” With my part of the report I make a quick salute before stepping out of the frame.
00:59] Kire Brownback: And I am Captain Kire Brownback of the Falcon de Lacey class, Peregrine, signing off he presses the button behind his back, and the red light switched off
[01:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a chuckle behind you. “look at you all cute and official, Have I ever said that you look cute in your little white uniform?”
[01:04] Kire Brownback: he blushes heavily thanks he gives you a quick hug how do you think that went?
[01:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I hug you back and give you a quick peck on the cheek “It went fine although it is awkward talking to a camera.”
[01:07] Kire Brownback: chuckels yeah, it is he take the SD card out and puts it into the computer ava, send the video file, graph recordings, and pictures of the sensor to control
[01:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sidle up next to you and wrap my arms around your waist from behind. “We still have some time...”
[01:13] Kire Brownback: he blushes softly, then sighs are you into BDSM?
[01:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I slide my paws lower down onto your waist and then answer “I’ve always been interested I’m not going to lie. The thought of someone having complete control over me... well...” I press my hips against your butt to let you feel the bulge that’s straining against my coveralls.
[01:17] Kire Brownback: he gulps and then smirks well I have a but of experience in it... And if today's inspections go well.. I'll give you a beginners class
[01:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I groan and press myself harder into you. “Ughhh your such a tease!” I complain only half joking
[01:18] Kire Brownback: he giggles which will make it even better~
[01:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stick my tongue out at you and then grab my tablet trying my best to ignore the large hard-on in my pants. I press a button on my tablet and a quick swoosh sound plays only to be replaced by a notification on yours. “I split the engineering checklist up by categories one is things you know how to do and the other is things I don’t want you to mess up.” I say trying my best to tease you back for making me so horny.
[01:27] Kire Brownback: he chukles and begins to look over the list ok, these all seem to be pretty easy and simple
[01:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah I’m going to get a head start on mine “I’ll meet you back in the room as soon as we’re done.” I turn around and walk into the engineering bay grabbing a test set with me as I enter the restricted access area that house the dual core controls. I press my dog tags to the scanner and enter the room. Before the doors close I yell. “If you need me EVA can patch you in to me.”
[01:35] Kire Brownback: Got it! Sits down and begins to get to work hmm..
[01:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I work hard in the room running through all the run up and warm-up procedures to make sure the cores are running at peak proficiency. Humming happily while I work looking forward to my first “lesson”
01:51] Kire Brownback: a few hours have passed, and the manuver has just acured alright, were in the green for engine shutdown. Going to keep the backups up just incase
[01:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Understood main drive cool down procedures in process eta 1 hour and 30 before they reach acceptable temperatures for interior invasive drive inspection.” I type into my tablet frantically until finally 3 quick chimes emanates from it and the lights start to dim a bit a result of the fluctuation of power as we switch to the back-up cores.
[01:57] Kire Brownback: Understood. Ava begin recording of all data. Ambrose prepare for inspection.
[01:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and go into the engineering rooms equipment room where I change into the thermal resistant skin tight suit used for inspecting the drives.
[02:03] Kire Brownback: puts on his com head set captain on com, can you hear me, Ambrose? He begins to gets his dashboard setup and ready, making sure to have the cameras up
[02:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I put my helmet on and then turn the coms and cameras on. “Yeah I hear you five by five are you getting readings from the helmet cam?”
[02:06] Kire Brownback: Yep highlights that one in particular your clear to go(edited)
[02:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a sigh and then start walking towards sealed doors that leave to the main drives. “AVA set gravity to 0 percent and give me cerebral initiated magnetization on my boots and gloves please. Kire I need you to set my camera to FLIR and watch for any hotspots in there the suit can protect me from any ambient heat but if I cross into one of those pockets I’m toast.” I take another deep breath and then activate the door override causing the klaxons to get set off which can be only heard for a second as all the atmosphere in the room is vented.
[02:13] Kire Brownback: types a bit done. He frowns shouldn't it be cool in there? Cause the walls appear to be extremely hot
[02:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “These drives have to stay on if they were ever to shut off completely we would never be able to restart them, the cool down is a flow restriction process that cuts the amount of ion particles propelling us down to 1% which is just enough for me to be in here. Unfortunately the drives are still incredibly hot but within survivable levels. Thankfully we should only have to do this about once every month.” * I say say this while attaching  a cable from my suits belt to the tie down beside the door. As soon as I’m secure I push out cautiously and start my drift into drive my right hand constantly tapping the suits thrust controls attached to my left wrist.* “How are we looking stud?” I ask as I start to inspect the drives slowly
[02:20] Kire Brownback: All good from what I'm seeing. Hot spot below left foot
[02:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod already sweating hard in my suit “Yeah I feel it...” grunt grimly wishing that the engines got cold instead of hot desperately. “Fuel lines are good moving towards the thrust nozzles keep an eye out.”
[02:24] Kire Brownback: 10/4. Moving flir display to your side helmet monitor drags it to the side and, hopefully, to his helmet display
[02:29] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Got it.” I jet slowly towards the thrust nozzles making sure to stay beside it and not in front of it since it was still emitting a small supercharged stream of ion energy.  It takes me 25 minutes but I finally reach the nozzles and as expected they are perfect. “Heading on out interior is done and thank goodness.” After another 30 minutes of careful piloting around invisible heat pockets I reach the door and close it behind me the room instantly repressurizing behind me. As soon as the gravity resets I sit down and take off my helmet as fast as possible taking deep breaths of the cool air.(edited)
[02:30] Kire Brownback: he takes of his head set and heads over how was it?
[02:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look up at you my face drenched in sweat and give you a crooked smile “Hot as hell but not as hot as you right now.” I say with a tired chuckle “In all seriousness though everything looks perfect in there but man was that nerve wrecking.”(edited)
[02:33] Kire Brownback: he blushes a bit good now, Ava, shower warm, medium pressure. Sweaty otter is on it's way
[02:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a laugh and start to strip out of the thermal suit leaving me nude my hair shiny and slick with sweat. I put it up in the decontaminator and pad into the shower room
[02:38] Kire Brownback: smiles I'll be in the bed room. You better be dry when you come in
[02:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Grumble and mumble something about “Otter never being dry” and the door closes behind me. 25 minutes pass and a much cleaner and drier otter walks into the bedroom in his loungewear.
[02:43] Kire Brownback: Kire is waiting there, wearing a black leather thong. A spoll of blank rope, a ball gag, a blindfold, some vibrators, and many toys with cum tubes are laid out on the bed ah good. You here
11:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look up from the floor when I walk in and stop in my tracks my eyes wide with a look of surprise and shock. “O-ohhh umm.... honey I’m home?” I say awkwardly completely caught off guard by the wide assortment of “activities” arranged.
[11:47] Kire Brownback: chukles a bit we'll get arround to that stuff in good time, but we need to talk about some stuff first. Sits down on the side of the bed
[11:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sit down next to you and take my paw into yours “Yeah sure, what’s up?”(edited)
[11:56] Kire Brownback: he giggles not that type of talk, more.... Kinky type of things
[11:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I relax a little bit and give you a nefarious wink “Ooooh kinky things I like the sound of that. What do you want to talk about?”
[11:58] Kire Brownback: smirks what do you like? Bondage? Pumping? Being filled with my sweet, warm cum?
[12:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cheeks flush a light shade of pink as I look away. “Well I always have wanted to try bondage... and I’ve never done pumping, but I do love being filled I love the feeling of you cumming hard inside of me. To me there is no better feeling.” by the time I’m done talking my face has turned a bright shade of crimson.
[12:07] Kire Brownback: smiles wonderful, cause I have just the right things for that.
[12:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give your paw a little squeeze “I’m looking forward to it~”
[12:09] Kire Brownback: nods what should the safe word be?
[12:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I think Elon should do but I’ll let you know I’m not a quitter.”
[12:12] Kire Brownback: he nods ok... Stands up and sets the toys on the ground on the bed with your arms and legs spread
[12:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stand up from the side of the bed and lay down on my back with my arms and led spread eagles just like you commanded me too.
[12:20] Kire Brownback: he nods good boy begins to tie his limbs down to the bed, making it difficult to move
[12:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: as you tie each of my limbs down my breathing starts from soft to harder a subtle stirring in my sheath can be seen through my lounge pants “T-this is so hot.” I murmur softly.
[12:30] Kire Brownback: smiles good. He grabs a vibrating wand, and puts a device on it that perfecting fits arround his cock
[12:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look interested at that a begin to squirm under the ropes.
[12:33] Kire Brownback: he smiles is recommended to stop squirming unless you want me to pump your cum back into you
[12:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stop squirming but you can tell from my red face that I’m all hot and bothered “that’s honestly sounds hot...”
[12:41] Kire Brownback: he sighs do you find everything hot?
[12:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug “when it cums to being filled with cum then yes.....”
[12:43] Kire Brownback: he face paws, then turns the toy on to high and slips it over your cock
[12:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my eyes go wide for a second before I shudder my cock bouncing as I try in vain to jump the air. “M-mmmph ohhh yisssss.” *the hiss getting followed shortly by a cute keening moan.”
[12:53] Kire Brownback: giggles cutie puts some lube on his fingers and slowly rubs them arround his pucker
12:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: When I feel the familiar sensation of your fingers tantalizingly lining around my hole my cock jumps hard in the air with the wand. “ahhhh M-mmhmm....” My mind too focused on the pure feeling of everything to be able to form actual words.
[13:12] Kire Brownback: smiles and starts to slide the fingers in, wiggling them arround
[13:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: relax my ass and let you slide easily inside giving out a soft mewl as you sink into me while wiggling a finger tip occasionally pressing against my prostate causing me to let out a louder moan. “Ooooh-OHH~”
[13:25] Kire Brownback: he smiles and buts his head into the end of the toy, pushing it into his cock
[13:28] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “The moment the wands vibrating head makes contact with my tip I let out a long moan my ass clenching hard around your fingers trying to milk them of their non existent cum.” “Hah H-ah Ki-rrrreee” I call out loudly my hips trying again to thrust in vain.(edited)
[13:37] Kire Brownback: he smiles and slides his fingers out yes?~
[13:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I whimper as you slide your fingers out.... “Ah~ I need more.... hah hah hah~ please.” I whimper out my ears pressed back against my head.
[13:43] Kire Brownback: starts to rub his tip slowly I'd recommend to shut your mouth unless you want to be gagged and blindfolded
[13:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I whimper out a final pitiful “Please...?”
[13:47] Kire Brownback: smirks soon he turns off the vibrator, then grabs the ball gag and blind fold if you ever feel unsafe or want to stop, just say the safe word he puts the ball gag in his mouth and clicks it behind his head, then puts on the blindfold on him(edited)
[13:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The gag is large in my mouth and I already could feel saliva start to drool from around it and the sudden loss of sight was disorienting but surprisingly only served to turn me on more pre already dripping from my rigid cock.
[13:51] Kire Brownback: turns the vibrator back onto high, then looking arround for some bullet vibes
[13:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Mmmmmphhhh!!” even though the wand wasn’t yet touching my tip the sudden stimulation was already causing more pre to flow.
[13:54] Kire Brownback: he notices this appears we have a pretty happy otter here he sets 2 bullet vibes around his cock and turns them onto low
[13:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: through my hash of need I could feel two rounded objects get placed around my cock. I wondered hard what it could be but when the low vibration suddenly starts I knew immediately that they were bullets. My cock bobs hard as they activate it struggling to find some sort of friction or something to get closer to release.
[14:00] Kire Brownback: he smiles and slowly turns them up(edited)
[14:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Mmmphh” my moan coming out muffled from the gag my hips straining to jump the air or do anything for more relief.
[14:02] Kire Brownback: holds his legs down onto the bed, smirking
[14:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I groan into the gag my cock flexing uselessly in the air.
14:08] Kire Brownback: he squeezes the top of his cock your tiny cock is adorable
[14:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: as soon as I hear those words my cock erupts my whole body shaking as I cum hard “MMMMMMPPPHHH!” I scream into my gag.
[14:17] Kire Brownback: he smiles sits back, not bothering to turn any of the toys off, just seeing how long he can last
[14:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The vibrations keep my orgasm going spurt after spurt cumming out before I’m left with my balls empty. “Mmmpphhhmm mmmmm~” I groan out in bliss
[14:20] Kire Brownback: he stands up and walks over to him how we feeling, slut?
[14:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My body still shakes gently from the intense orgasm and all I can do is moan into the gag drool absolutely running down my cheeks.
[14:31] Kire Brownback: he giggles and gives you cheek a very light kiss, followed by a nose boop(edited)
[14:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The kiss was expected but the sudden boop causes me to jump in my binding in surprise my still hard cock bobbing around in the air
[14:34] Kire Brownback: he goes over and turns off the bullet vibes
[14:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: you hear a quiet groan for only a second before I catch myself and stay quiet not wanting to acquire any more “punishments” from the ships Captain.
[14:39] Kire Brownback: he smiles and then grabs a book, sitting down in a chair and reading
[14:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The first few minutes I stay still perfectly but as 5 minutes drag on to 10 minutes and 10 to 15 I begin to struggle in my bonds my cock still rock hard in the air.
[14:42] Kire Brownback: he looks over at him at about the 15 minute mark how you doing?
[14:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “MMMMMPHHHH! Mmmmpphh, mmmpphhh.” The last to grunt coming out sounding more like needy sobs.
[14:44] Kire Brownback: he marks the page in his book and walks over, lifting the gag out of his mouth what was that?
[14:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Kire I need to be fucked, I can’t stand it anymore.” I whimper the words out pathetically my mouth still covered in drool from the ball gag.(edited)
[14:49] Kire Brownback: he smirks I might give you tha- 
AVA attention, thruster shut down sequence has been initiated due to a major sensor failure an alarms starts to sound
[14:50]Kire ah, fuck he quickly undos the ropes takes off the cock pump
[14:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “GODDAMNIT!” I shout loudly genuinely pissed for the first time since the start. “Cheap fucking Chinese parts I swear to GOD!” As soon as I’m free I start sprinting naked towards engineering “Kire bring my tablet... and my work gloves!”
[14:54] Kire Brownback: Ava, gravity 5% he picks them up and slides then over to him in the low gravity, getting over to his station and putting on coms, then cursing a large amount were gonna have to be quick. Next manuver is in 45 minutes. Falts in engine 1, 2. Engine tempeture is currently unknown
[15:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I get to my station and grab my comms headset putting it on quick. “That isn’t over do you here me? We are not done yet.” After I get that outburst out of the way I study my detailed panel (shows everything where yours just shows stuff that you’d understand.) after a quick examination I let out a sigh “There’s no way we are going to make the 45 minute mark all of my flow sensors are alarming along drive 1 and drive 3. That’s over 300 sensors along 600 meters of drive chamber. But it looks like it’s just a single sensor fault daisy chained the rest of them into alarming.”
[15:03] Kire Brownback: 10/4, noted. Starts to type in rapidly Ava, prepare for emergency burn using back up engines. Ambrose, your clear to go in once you have the parts, but be prepared to grab onto something at any second
[15:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I scramble to key my comms. Negative negative I have a solution before we have to do an emergency burn.” I say quickly my mind piecing the steps together as I speak “AVA engineering emergency protocol override, November, one, oh. One, Lima, Alpha. Authenticate.”

AVA “Authentication confirmed state engineer level bypass.”

[15:13]Ambrose “deactivate all ion flow sensors and reconfigure the numbers 3,13,4,14 emissions sensors to monitor for ion flow variance greater than 4% norm from thrust level index.”(edited)
[15:13] Kire Brownback: he blinks, having only the slightest clue as to what he just said, and hoping that this is being recorded. He starts up a game of solitaire do you need me to help with anything, casue you seem like you have this under control
[15:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I need you to tell me if our thrust output seems normal. Take it through a few maneuvers and let me knowing if it seems likes it’s slipping anywhere.” right as finish speak all alarms cut off and then a new one starts something high pitched and beeping rapidly
[15:22] Kire Brownback: Got it he shushes the alarm and starts to monitor thrust output, muttering something under his breath of "why did I choose to piolet this piece of junk" as he takes manual control  and very very slightly moves it to the side* all appears to be normal, from what I'm seeing
[15:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Understood my personal tablet will monitor for any changes to the flow we’ll have to wait till we hit the Orbius yards in mars to fix those sensors in dry dock.” I close the tablet and take it with me back to our room
[15:25] Kire Brownback: he nods we should be there soon. Its only about 1000 miles away from current position he is currently playing solitaire
[15:28] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’d recommend reducing thrust to 10% till we arrive It’ll be safer in case we do develop a flow issue. Also you better drag your slender tail back in here.” You can hear me call out as I reach our bedroom*
[15:29] Kire Brownback: laughes what do you want me to do with my tail sets the main thrust to 10% use it on you like a whip?
[15:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I don’t answer all you can hear is the door shut to our room
[15:32] Kire Brownback: he rolls his eyes and then stands up, going over there and knocking on the door
[15:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The door opens on it’s own and laying on the bed is me blindfold on gag in mouth laying spread eagle again.
[15:39] Kire Brownback: Damn. Amazed you got those on your self he reaches down and holds up a horse cock now I hope your strechy
[15:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and try to say something around the gag which is of course unintelligible, finally I give up and point to the restraints for my arms and legs which were still untied.
[15:42] Kire Brownback: he sets the xl horse cock down on the bed, then turns him onto his belly and ties his legs down I'd recommend to hold onto a pillow
[15:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I reach around blindly until I find one then I grab onto it tightly
[15:53] Kire Brownback: he smiles and puts a very generous amount of lube on the toy remember, the safe word is Elon... And also, go ahead and take the gag off. I wanna hear your cute little moans he lines the toy up against his ass
[15:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I reach behind and undo the gags clasps quickly. When I feel the tip line up against my ass I instinctively press back against it slightly, when I do I get a grasp of just how big that thing is. “That seems rather large.”
[15:58] Kire Brownback: he nods, smirking chance, extra large, unflared he begins to push the giant head of the cock into his anus 
16:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My mouth opens wide as the wide head pushes against my ring I try to relax as best as I can and feel the head slowly stretch me open. “Mmmm!” I can’t help but let out a high pitched moan as I get stretched and stretched. “Oh gods Kire oh fuck.... oh fuck me, oh fuck me,....” I start to babble between sharp gasps and soft moans until finally with a sharp intake of breath the tips slips past my stretched ring. “Oooooooooh!!!! Is it all the way in?”
[16:05] Kire Brownback: he shakes his head we got about 13 more inches he puts more lube on it and starts to slide it in slowly
[16:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Oooohhhhmmmmmm!!!” My legs shake and I squeeze the pillow tightly while chance slowly fills me inch by inch. “Oh my god I-Im s-s-Sooo full ahhhghhhh!” my moans come out unrestricted as chance starts to fill every inch of me.
[16:09] Kire Brownback: he smiles and stops pushing, then starting to planting kisses up his back(edited)
[16:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I feel you stop and I take a moment to catch my breath enjoying the quick kisses of what I take as encouragement. “mmmm feels so full so gud....” My face bright red with drool slightly coming from my mouth.
[16:13] Kire Brownback: he smiles how are you doing, hunny?
[16:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m doing good I’m ready for the rest, sir.” I add the sir in as an after thought and adjust my position slightly to raise my butt up towards you.
[16:17] Kire Brownback: he nods wonderful, dear he begins to push more of the dildo into him
[16:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grunt and take another few inches before I gasp out “Elon.” *I take another few seconds to catche my breath. “I think I’m out of room you need to stretch me out from here.”
[16:19] Kire Brownback: he stops imediatly, then tilts his head so you want to suck on a giant horse cock?
[16:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I want you to fuck me with this horse cock and then I want to be filled with your cum.” I answer slightly bouncing back on the dildo.
16:22] Kire Brownback: he giggles, and starts to thrust the toy in and out slowly
01:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The large toy slides in an out smoothly my ass clinging tightly around me as it slowly stretches me out. “Ooooohhh mmmmmm..” You can tell how much I’m enjoying the feeling of being overstuffed with the amount of drool hanging from open gasping mouth.
[01:22] Kire Brownback: he slowly speeds up the thrusting with the toy, smirking and slapping the otters ass
[01:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft cute moan when you slap my ass, my hips starting to move back to meet the large toy. “Hah... Hah... F-fuck kire f-feels amazing.” My cock jumps every time the head presses over my sensitive prostate a thick strand connecting my tip to the bed underneath me.
[01:29] Kire Brownback: he smiles I'm glad you do, dear he pushes the toy a tiny bit deeper
[01:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a loud moan as it slides in deeper my ass seeming to finally fully relax to this monster. “A-aahhh s-so full soooo good~”
[01:31] Kire Brownback: he lets it stay there, moving both of his paws on to the otters cheeks and massaging them softly(edited)
[01:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I press my ass back into your paws shaking my ass slightly as you massage my soft cheeks. “How’s the v-view from b-back there?” I manage to pant out between soft mewls and moans.
[01:36] Kire Brownback: As beautiful as space it's self, Hun squeezes both of his cheeks together arround the toy(edited)
[01:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Ahhhhhh!” I cry out as the toy presses against what feels like all my sensitive spots at once my cock letting out a fresh spurt of pre-cum.(edited)
[01:39] Kire Brownback: he puts his paws under his belly, feeling how wet he is well, well, well, appears your pretty wet down there.
[01:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: All I can do is moan as your paw rubs against my hard slick member more pre dribbling from the tip. “m-mmmmhmmm.”
[01:42] Kire Brownback: pulls one paw away and sets it on the base of the toy do I need to put you in chastity? Squeezes his cock and pushes another inch of the toy in
[01:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a long cute moan as the toy presses even deeper inside me my cocks flow of pre stopped with you squeezing my cock causing me to whine softly
[01:47] Kire Brownback: he let's go of his cock when your adorable when you whine and moan rotates the toy around in you
[01:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my ass bucks back against the toy as you start to slowly spin it my cock dribbling even more pre down to the bed a large wet spot starting to form “mmmrrrrpphhhh!!!” I moan out loudly burying my face into the pillow as my toes curl from the pure bliss I’m feeling.
[01:51] Kire Brownback: he starts to thrust the toy in as well as swiveling it arround, then starts to stroke his cock you should really get one of those cock pumps for you micro dick
[01:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my muffled agreement can be heard through the pillow as I push back against your thrusts taking the toy in even deeper than before my cock coated in my pre as you stroke you can feel it throb in time with each time medial ring rubs my prostate
[01:55] Kire Brownback: smirks, and starts to pull the toy out of him slowly(edited)
[01:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I groan as the glorious feeling of being soo full get replaced with feeling empty
[01:57] Kire Brownback: he pulls it out completely, and sets it on the ground, starting to stroke him faster
[01:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: It slides out with a pop my ass left gaping before you. “MMMpppphhhh!” I moan out into the pillow my cock starting to thin in your skilled hand.
[02:00] Kire Brownback: he let's go of his cock turn your self over, slut
[02:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I groan in disappointment when you let go of my throbbing cock. I was soo close. “F-fine.” I murmur as I slowly turn myself over and lay on my back for you.
[02:04] Kire Brownback: he smiles, then leans down and kisses the tip of your member
[02:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a small gasp my eyes locked on yours almost begging you. “Please....”
[02:06] Kire Brownback: he smirks and looks at you I might.... He stands up or I might leave you in this state until we undock from Mars
[02:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I throw my head back and moan at the thought of being pent up for that long. “Ohhh gods...”
[02:08] Kire Brownback: Ava, how much longer till we reach our docking location in Mars?
[02:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “at the ships current pace we will dock at the orbius in 4 days”
[02:10] Kire Brownback: he smirks, patting his cock thank you.... And also get me a small lock and key
[02:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my cock jumps at the small pat while the lock and key appear on the bedside table. “Fuck Kire I’m going to go crazy if I can’t cum.” I say slowly you can tell I don’t really mean it and the renewed dribble coming from my tip showing what I really think.
[02:15] Kire Brownback: chukles which is just what I want he goes to the computer and begins to design something
[02:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: as you design something my paw goes to my still slightly gaping ass 3 fingers easily sliding inside of me causing my cock to jump in the air.
[02:18] Kire Brownback: he looks back at him through a corner of his eye you better not be jerking your self off he  takes a couple of quick measurement of the lock, then hits print on the computer(edited)
[02:19] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my paw slips away from ass not wanting to anger you and I look up to the see what the 3D printer is making.
02:25] Kire Brownback: it appears to be making a bright pink chastity belt, with a hole near his tip for him to pee out of
15:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock jumps up when I realize what’s printing. My paw going to my hard length and stroking it once as I let out a soft whine.
[15:16] Kire Brownback: he looks stands up and gets the chastity belt, beginning to clean it up I'd recommend to start softening your micro cock, unless you want me to squish it forcefully
[15:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a groan my paw dripping from my shaft. “I-I don’t think I can...”
[15:18] Kire Brownback: he walks over you got ten minutes to get soft sets the Chasity cage on the night stand next to the horse cock but you can not cum(edited)
[15:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I groan my cock throbbing with my pulse as I gently massage my swollen balls. “please...?”
[15:23] Kire Brownback: crosses his arms nope he unties him you can go exercise, work, draw. Anything, but if you jerk off at all your sleeping in the engineering bay(edited)
[15:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I think about it for a second then stand up and head to the showers. “AVA set shower temp to icy and jets on hard.” I walk slowly to the showers my cock bobbing up and down while I make my way there .
[15:35] Kire Brownback: cackles I'll be waiting right outside the shower for you he follows a bit behind him, holding the lock and chastity cage behind his back
[15:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I enter the shower and not 30 seconds later a loud “Yooooowwwwww!” Followed by a loud thud and me running out of the shower as fast as possible. Slamming straight into you at full speed on accident
[15:42] Kire Brownback: Ack! He gets knocked down onto the ground the the running otter
[15:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I blink realizing that I’m on my back after a few seconds. “AVA! How cold was that water and why was it salty!?” 

AVA “the water was 21 degrees the reason for the salt was to prevent the water from freezing, this was done in attempt to help dissipate your erection.”
[15:45] Kire Brownback: he grins widely and then cackles Ava, remind me to upgrade your ram when we get to Mars.(edited)
[15:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shiver my paws rubbing my chest in an attempt to build up my body heat back. My cock however was back in my sheath. “Sooo fucking cold... I’m never saying icy again around that........ murderous lil...... ” I mutter grumpily
[15:48] Kire Brownback: *he nods, and then looks down at her cock to see if he is softt yet
15:52] Kire Brownback: he smirks and puts his cock in it, then puts the lock in there this won't come off until AFTER we undock from Mars, got it?
[15:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “But what about the Orbius’s pleasure district?” I groan out realizing just what I got myself into.
[15:57] Kire Brownback: boops him on the nose you'll just have to watch *he moves away from him
[16:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look at the hot pink chasitiy belt and groan as I feel my cock stiffen uncomfortably inside at the mention of possibly watching you.
[16:05] Kire Brownback: stands up now, we need to get back to work he grabs his uniform order of the ground and hands it to him
[16:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take the orders and stand up off the ground heading to the room to get dressed.
[16:08] Kire Brownback: he grabs his uniform and puts it on as well, sighing after words, then going to his post
[16:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I zip into my coveralls and head for engineering walking slightly funny as I adjust to the tightness of the chastity belt.
[16:12] Kire Brownback: smiles, then puts his headser on and begins to looks at what was recorded while they were having fun alright, everything seems good on the engines from my end
[16:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Engines are operating within norms on this end as well. I’m going to steadily raise the gain by 5 percent every 6 hours to see if we can get to mars a bit faster. I don’t like having one of the most important sensors out for this long.”
[16:16] Kire Brownback: Agreed, get me the parts you need so I can order them, and they should be ready once we get there
[16:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Just let the Work crew at the shipyards know that we need a full engine tune and have them replace every single sensor in engineering.
[16:19] Kire Brownback: Got it types that in and sends it to them
[16:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m going to run through my daily checklist and then send my engineering report. I’m not sure what you need to do today but I suggest you finish it now while we are here.”
[16:22] Kire Brownback: Not much, honestly. If you need any help, just tell me.
[16:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: * let out a chuckle and moan into the mic loudly* “you can help me cum baby...” I whimper into the mic.
[16:29] Kire Brownback: growls back I can make that tighter, you knoe
[16:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I laugh and close my comms and start typing out the sophisticated report about the total sensor failure earlier.
[16:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: (Hey really bad storm outside I may lose power and internet the lights are already flickering
[16:34] Kire Brownback: (ok)
[16:34] Kire Brownback: he sighs and leans back in his chair, looking up at the skylight, looking at the stary expanse of space above them
[16:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “Proximity alert ahead bear right 7 degrees.”
[16:45] Kire Brownback: he sits back up and takes control Ambrose, brace. Ava, give me the distance to object, and object type
20:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “object catalogued as a rouge asteroid, distance is 15 kilometers and closing.”

Ambrose “What’s going on?!”
[20:56] Kire Brownback: Rouge object, Ambrose. Secure any lose objects. Can we go full on the side thrusters?
[21:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A brief pause takes place and frantic typing can be heard as I run a series of projections. “We can do a hard lateral burn for 60 seconds without having to draw power from our other core which we won’t be able to do with malfunctioning drive sensors.”
[21:02] Kire Brownback: AVA 10 kilometers

KIRE how far away will we be from it?(edited)
[21:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Before I can answer the clear neutral voice of AVA answers for me 

AVA “a 45 second burn will give us sufficient distance away from the asteroid.”
[21:06] Kire Brownback: Then let's do it. Ava, take control. All crew, brace and secure any unsecured object. Ava, burn in 5 seconds
[21:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “AVA set artificial gravity to off to minimize damage to equipment from falling.” I call out hastily knowing there is no time to secure everything.
[21:10] Kire Brownback: AVA artifical gravity turned off. Burning in three... Two.. one... Zero. The second she says zero, the ship propels it self away from the asteroid, everyone getting pressed to their seats or a wall
[21:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A crash can be heard over my mic as well as some sort of muffled alarm in AVA’s voice
[21:13] Kire Brownback: he would face paw, but the force of the engine is crushing him so much that he can barley speak
[21:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “Burn ending in 3...2...1...mark.” at Mark the ship stops accelerating to side all g forces abating after a few seconds.

AVA “Medical emergency in Engineering crewmen Ambrose is unconscious and in need of emergency assistance.”
[21:20] Kire Brownback: kire launches out of his seat and floats himeelf toward the engineering bay Ava, prepare medical bay 1 with bed and drip
[21:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “Medical bay 1 is ready and waiting the emergency medical holographic subroutine is active.”
[21:31] Kire Brownback: Good he sees Ambrose and picks him up in his arms oh honey please be ok he jumps off of one of the walls, still holding him tight, and heads to med bay one
[21:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A quick cursory glance and a large gash across my head can be seen with burn scoring on my fur nothing serious but enough to make me patchy.
[21:39] Kire Brownback: he whines softly and sets him on the bed medical, where are you
[21:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: An all white Female wolf appears next to you in an instant activating the beds holographic interface showing accurate body scans and readings “Please step away from the patient so I can begin to administer treatment.” Her voice taking on an attractive placating tone.
[21:49] Kire Brownback: he imediatly steps backwards a few step y-yes ma'am(edited)
[21:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She presses an oxygen mask to his face before her hand moves deftly begins to clean out the gash in his forehead. “Subject has hemorrhaging inside his cranium I recommend minimally invasive surgery to release pressure on his brain.”
[21:57] Kire Brownback: he nods weve got about 4 days till we reach a hospital. Do you think you could do the surgery?
[21:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she turns around and her eyes flash a bright purple as she does a through scan of you. “You’re expressing symptoms of anxiety and of being emotionally distraught do you require assistance?”
[22:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: (I know she completely ignored you I meant to do that.)
[22:00] Kire Brownback: he shakes his head and sighs no,  fine. I'm just wondering if you are capable of doing the surgery. I have basic first aid, but nothing past that(edited)
[22:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She turns back around to his unmoving body the chest barely rising and falling the only outwards signs of life. “It is recommended that a real doctor preform this procedure,but that is not available to us now.” the longer the hologram stay active it seems the more life like and less stiff she gets her voice going from scripted to more fluid and life like dialogue. “All I can do is promise to do my best to you.” As she say this she turns around and places a paw on your shoulders “I will take care of him Kire why don’t you go rest, I let you know as soon as something changes okay?” Her eyes are caring and her voice holds sympathy and understanding whoever programmed seems to have made it fully sentient.
[22:11] Kire Brownback: he sighs I will, ma'am... He turns arround And walks away sadly, head in to his room and ploping down on the bead Ava... How much longer do we have?
[22:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “We are 3 days and 7 hours from the Orbius shipyard.” her tone seeming less bright and cheerful “Ambrose is a strong otter specimen there is a high probability of survival.” She seemed to be trying to console you albeit in an awkward manner.
[22:19] Kire Brownback: he nods I know, Ava he pulls the sheets over himself and closes his eyes only wake me in an emergency, or when we arrive to the shipyard he yawns and wraps him self up in the blanket, then falls asleep
[22:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: several hours pass until there’s a soft knock on the door. “Kire? Are you up? I have an update on Ambrose for you.” Her voice ringing cheerfully through the door
[22:24] Kire Brownback: he is fast asleep, clearly not planning on waking up anytime soon
[22:24] Kire Brownback: AVA kire is currently sleeping. Please leave all notices on his night stand, unless it is an emergency
[22:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The hologram enters through the doorway and walks to your night stand and writes a simple two word note “Surgery success.”
[22:29] Kire Brownback: kire moves a tiny bit, scrunching deeper into the towel
[22:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she looks down at you and decides that maybe you SHOULD find out now after all she was in charge of all medical treatment for the crew and he is showing signs of severe mental anguish. After a few more seconds she gently grabs your shoulder and shakes you. “Hey... Kire wake up.”
[22:38] Kire Brownback: he groans a bit, curling up tighter
[22:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She shakes you harder her brow furrowing. “Kire you need to wake up. I have news on Ambrose’s condition.”
[22:44] Kire Brownback: his ears perk up, but then go back down, and then he mumbles something
[22:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: her ears perk up and she places an ear in front of your mouth. “What’s that?”
[22:49] Kire Brownback: Lemme guess, it failed
[22:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She pulls away and crosses her arms in front of her chest. “I wouldn’t be a very good program if I couldn’t keep my patients in good health. No, the surgery was completely successful the hemorrhaging has stopped and his vitals are stable. If you’d like to see him he should be coming out from sedation in a few minutes.”(edited)
[22:53] Kire Brownback: he imediatly perks up and practically launches him self out of bed r-really?
[22:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she grabs his shoulders to stop him “W-wait! Hold on for a second he’s still has a bad concussion so please be gentle with him. And when you’re done please stop by medical bay 2 for a psychological evaluation.”
[23:00] Kire Brownback: he nods o-ok ma'am he jogs out of the room and to medical bay one, looking inside
[23:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My eyes barely flutter open and they immediately shut the light above burning my eyes like staring directly into the sun. “A-m I d-dead?”
[23:05] Kire Brownback: he goes over to the side of his bed and take his paw no, dear. Your Alive and welll... I hope
[23:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grip your paw weakly and try opening my eyes again squinting into the bright overhead light. “Dim the lights hun..”
[23:09] Kire Brownback: he squeezes your paw a bit tighter Ava, med bay 1, lights at 25%
[23:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: the lights dim and my eyes open and find your face tears running down my cheeks “I’m glad your okay... I thought we might have hit the asteroid and I just didn’t know and I was scared and I-I.” I trail off after my little freak out
[23:15] Kire Brownback: he leans down and kisses him deeply and passionately, then breaks it Hun, if we had an impact with an asteroid, you would know he smiles down at him
[23:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I kiss you back weakly and laugh. “I guess your right huh.... are we on mars? I kept dream about what sounded like a woman humming maybe it was the doctor?”
[23:19] Kire Brownback: he looks arround medical staff. Speaking of her, I need to go and get a psychological evaluation
[23:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my eyebrows scrunch up to a curious arch. “wha why?”
[23:23] Kire Brownback: he shrugs ask medical why he leans down and kisses you again I've got to go, love. I'll be right next door he walks away and heads toward medical bay 2(edited)
[23:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The wolfess is sitting down in one of two large cushioned seats. Her posture is relaxed and welcoming one long leg draped over the other long perfect white leg. “I’m glad that you’re here Captain Kire please take a seat would you like anything to eat or drink? There is an organic matter replicator in this room for you to use.”
[23:32] Kire Brownback: he goes over and sits down on another, still in his suit from yesterday no thanks, ma'am. I'm fine
[23:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Her blue eyes briefly flash purple a sign that she scanned your vital signs. “There’s no need to be so formal please make yourself comfortable.”
[23:35] Kire Brownback: he nods, and his posture imediatly relaxes as he head falls into his paws
[23:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She reaches for glass of water on the table next to her and takes a small sip before putting it down and materializing a clipboard from air. “please understand that anything you say to me is confidential I will never report your what you say or anything else to the mission board I’m here for the CREW, not the mission.”
[23:41] Kire Brownback: he nods thank you after rubbing his face a bit, he decides to lay down on seat, closing his eyes and taking slow, deep breaths(edited)
[23:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Can you tell me how you are feeling right now?”
[23:43] Kire Brownback: Stressed, scared... Anxoius? I don't really know..
[23:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It’s understandable seeing as what happened to your crewmate but he seems to be recovering well I thought the news might have put you at ease but that doesn’t seem to be the case. May I query- I mean ask you some more specific questions?” She ask her face flushing a light embarrassed shade of pink at her slip up.
[23:48] Kire Brownback: he nods of course.
[23:48] Kire Brownback: I'll tell you if I don't want to answer
[23:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “What exactly are you anxious about?”
[23:54] Kire Brownback: Dying... Ambrose dying... Anyone that I care about getting hurt rubs his face slowly crashing into something... Failing at my job... Just... So much stuff
[23:55] Kire Brownback: Hell, even just tripping in front of Ambrose and run into him!
10 October 2018
[00:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She nods slowly putting down her clipboard and takes your paw in both of hers the hologram being sophisticated enough to feel perfectly real. “Kire you fear failure but look at what you’ve both accomplished so far. You two have single handedly proven yourselves the best in the hardest training program in the world and not only that but you two managed to keep your friendship in the midst of intense competition. You’ve taken on the challenge of commanding the most experimental and advanced starship furrkind has ever made and tackled the unique challenges that come with the territory of flying such an experimental ship. No furr thinks of you as failures in fact even if you had return to Earth no one would think any less of you because they know if you can’t do it than no one can.” Her words are passionate and confident her eyes seeming to fill with pride with each achievement she named. After she finishes she lets go of your paw and sits upright again in her chair. “As for Ambrose dying there is a higher risk of that happening on earth driving a vehicle. You both knew the risks and I’m sure he’d be the first to tell you that if anything ever did happen to him it wouldn’t be your fault.”
[00:10] Kire Brownback: he smiles widly, chukling a bit at her last comments on death thanks... But.. he sighs again, his mouth going from a smile to a line we're getter some technology upgrades when we arrive at Mars, along with the new sensors. We're being encouraged by Houston to be as quick as possible, since this project is already millions of dollars over due. He sits up i mean I've TRIED to create a somewhat sensible timeline for out docking period, but getting all of the sensors, the ring...it's gonna take over 2 weeks and we're gonna be over budget by BILLIONS then. Throws his paws up into the air
[00:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she smiles and lets out a chuckle. “I didn’t realize I was talking to the CFO for this mission... Houston knows that repairs and much needed upgrades take time and money they are only all over you so that THEIR boss stops getting all over them. Don’t worry Kire they won’t cancel this mission and leave a multi Trillion dollar mission leave a hole in their wallet with nothing to show for it.”
[00:17] Kire Brownback: he chukles I was the head designer of the ship, with assistance from Ambrose, you know. I know every passage way and.he knows every electrical conduit. We both are very good friends with the president, and would happily slap him if we could. He fiddles with his fingers there are rumors that the administrative board are going to meet us at dock... God I hope they are not true
[00:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Her eyes goes vacant for a few seconds and then refocus. “There will be no one waiting for you at the dock. All of your upgrades have been approved as well as priority maintenance status placed on your ship.” She reaches for the same water glass again taking another sip from the glass before setting it down. “You seem pretty clear to me and yes I know you’ve both worked in the design crew for this ship I know both your files inside out. Might I suggest that you take some R&R until we leave from mars? I say suggest because I like giving you the illusion of choice but it’s really non negotiable.”
[00:25] Kire Brownback: he smiles thats what I planned on doing anyway. He stands up and holds out a paw to shake thank you, for this
[00:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she stands up and takes your paw in hers. “I’ll be around for a little while I still need to check up on my patient every now and then and I hope that you might come back and talk with me every once in awhile when you start to feel a little overwhelmed?”
[00:28] Kire Brownback: he nods though I may not feel over whelmed, so you'll have to tell me to relax he shakes her paw
[00:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: as she shakes your paw she squeezes it hard and looks you directly in the eyes “Also please keep any... R&R involving Ambrose light he’s stable but he’s still hurt also I noticed a certain device when I was examining him....I left it in place for you.”
[00:32] Kire Brownback: he blushes a bit th-thanks. It's a bit of a... Punishment I gave him. He will get it taken off when we undock from Mars, unless you say otherwise
[00:32] Kire Brownback: And trust me, I'll be soft on him(edited)
[00:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She smiles knowingly. “Oh, I know EVAs kept me in the loop while I was deactivated knowing what’s going on with the crew is part of my programming.” Her ears perk up and turn to wall her eyes turning purple as she scans something unseen. “I need to check up on Ambrose why don’t you take a shower and get a meal in you before you come see him.”
[00:37] Kire Brownback: he shakes his head I'm just gonna shower then sleep. Only wake me if it's an emergency he walks out of the med bay towards the shower Ava, shower set to soft, warm(edited)
00:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Shower set to soft warm and a meal will be ready for you in your room it’s been 27 hours since your last intake of calories.”
[00:42] Kire Brownback: he sighs thank you, Ava he stripes down just out side the shower and puts his suit in the hamper, them gets into the shower and floats around, closing his eyes
[00:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: nothing happens during the time while your in the shower or after during your meal.
[00:51] Kire Brownback: once he is done, he walks toward his and Ambrose's room, curling up into a ball and falling asleep
00:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: 3 days pass while the ship slowly makes it’s way to the the orbital station Orbius around mars finally the ship jolts slightly as the docking seals make a positive latch. 

AVA “We have arrived at the Orbius orbital maintenance crews are onboard and starting work in engineering. Preparing to transfer Chief of engineering to the Orbius Hospital for final treatment.”
[00:59] Kire Brownback: kire yawns and gets up, hearing the click of the doors opening. Kire then gets his freshly washed suit and puts it on Ava, make me something to eat, please. And keep any possible tourists or press faaar away.
[01:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “All non transit corridors have been sealed to maintenance personnel. I have a high calorie meal waiting for you in the mess hall as wells as a@pot of tea on.”
[01:10] Kire Brownback: Thank you, ava. He sits down at the table and begins to eat what ever was set out how is Ambrose doing, Ava?
[01:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Ambrose has been in and out of consciousness the past few days and is currently in transit to the hospital.” the sounds of tools can be heard drifting down the hallway from engineering things already getting loud around here. “Do you require transportation around the Orbius?”
[01:15] Kire Brownback: No thanks. Keep eyes on maintenance to make sure they don't steal anything, k? He finishes his food and then stands up
01:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “All security measures are in place but risk of theft is low all workers are part of the original build team for the Peregrine and have top secret clearances.”
[01:20] Kire Brownback: stretches good he grabs his shoes and puts them on, then grabs his tablet and puts in an ear piece
[01:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: the sound of voices and tools can be heard throughout the ship as over 100 workers of different species all try to return the ship to flight status as quick as possible

A notification pings on your tablet from Ambrose just a simple text asking. “Where r u?”(edited)
[01:25] Kire Brownback: *he sighs and makes a quick notification to all staff quality over speed. When Ambrose is back up, he will probably go arround and check each sensor then responds to Ambrose getting my shoes on right now. Im bringing an ear piece with me so we can talk he heads toward the air lock(edited)
[01:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: your tablet gets a ringing notification indicating a private call that wouldn’t be reported in the ships logs.(edited)
[01:27] Kire Brownback: he taps on the notification as he puts in the exit code to leave
[01:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: the line is slightly staticky but the connection goes through well enough “Hey.” I say simply a slight tone of uncertainty inflicted in my voice.
01:34] Kire Brownback: Hey there Ambrose, how you doing? His mouth hangs open slightly as he gazes at the marvel of engineering of this station
[01:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: theres a long pause on my end “I miss you...”
[01:37] Kire Brownback: he looks around for a shop so do I. The bed was cold and lonely with out you
[01:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Are.... are you avoiding me?” his last words come out choked with emotion you can almost hear the tears through the mic.
[01:40] Kire Brownback: No, no, no. Hun. I'm grabbing somethings and then I  be right there he holds his tablet up to the stall, then sits down
[01:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I just haven’t seen you since the first time I woke up and I thought maybe.... maybe I don’t even know what I just miss you Kire...” he clears his throat uncomfortably and then starts again. “How’s my ship?”(edited)
[01:43] Kire Brownback: Good as ever. I told the maintenance crew to take there time, and that you will be inspecting each sensor he takes the box and puts it in a bag, looking arround for something
[01:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah they better... hey I had to sign some forms when I got here apparently we are taking on cargo but... well the cargo manifest doesn’t name what it is yet it’s deemed vital for flight operations.” you can hear a muffled cough over my mic. “heh sorry didn’t mean to cough into the mic.”
[01:49] Kire Brownback: he gulps audibly I know what those are for, and I'll tell you what there. He pays for the last item and head for the hospital I'm on my way now, dear
[01:50] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Okay I’m about to be put into a rejuv tank I’ll probably be there when you arrive.”
[01:51] Kire Brownback: How long will you be in there? Checks in with the front desk
[01:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my line goes dead at the front of the reception desk is a older male skunk in good shape he waves you forward with a warm smile crinkles forming at the edges of his eyes pleasantly. “How can I help you today sir?”
[01:53] Kire Brownback: he frowns and puts his tablet away I'm looking for Ambrose. I believe he is staying here for the time being?
[01:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Ahhh yes he’s just gotten into a rejuv tank take the elevator to the top floor and he’ll be the only one in a tank.”
[01:56] Kire Brownback: he nods how long is he going to be in there? He holds of a bag of black boxes I've got him some gifts
[09:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: the skunk shrugs unsure. “He could be in for awhile but you can still see him and talk to him while he’s in there.”
[11:56] Kire Brownback: he nods I'll let him be at peace for now. What room is he in?
15:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The orderly types into his console for a moment before look back up to you. “He will be in room 202019 sub level 12.”
[15:22] Kire Brownback: he nods is that the rejuv room or his main room? Pulls out his tablet and begins to type in a few notes
[15:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “That will be the room where the final check-up will be. As I said before the rejuv tanks are on the top floor.”
[15:24] Kire Brownback: he nods and notes that got it smiles I'll probably see you again. Thanks for the help. He walks off toward an elevator, then down to his floor
[15:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: the room itself is small with only a single chair and an examination table.
[15:30] Kire Brownback: he sighs, and sets the bag on the ground, then sits down, wondering how long it's going to take, and very tempted to visit him(edited)
[15:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: after about 30 minutes the door opens and Ambrose walks in still damp from his time in the rejuv tank at first he doesn’t notice you probably due to him towling off his head as he walked in but after he drop the towel his face makes a little Ohh of shock and he runs towards you not letting you get out of the chair before throwing you into a big hug. “Kire!”
[15:42] Kire Brownback: he gasps Ambrose! Hugs him back happily, purring a bit
[15:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: my lips find yours and I kiss you hard a few happy tears escaping form me as a laugh happily into our kiss.
[15:45] Kire Brownback: he holds you there happily, then breaking the kiss after a bit they didn't even give you a bed?
[15:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile happily at you  “I just spent 30 minutes in a rejuv tank top of the line, all that’s left is a final checkout and I’m free to go.” I stand back up and stretch. “I feel fantastic.”
[15:54] Kire Brownback: he smiles and hugs him again well, thinking you were gonna be in here longer he picks up the bag I got you some gifts
[15:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: an eyebrow raises slightly. “Ohhh what do you have there.”
[16:00] Kire Brownback: smiles and take the black boxes out. Ever one has his name in gold and fancy lettering on the top custom-made, just for you
[16:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: * Take the smooth silky boxes and open one looking in curiously*
[16:03] Kire Brownback: in side of it is a plush, grey feline in a white flight suitz sitting cross legged
[16:04] Kire Brownback: (there are 4 boxes, one is a bit bigger then the rest)
[16:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I lift up the grey feline and give out a loud “Awwwwww it’s you Kire! You look so cute as a plushie!” I give the plush a hug and set it beside me on the exam table opening up another of the smaller boxes(edited)
[16:16] Kire Brownback: in it is a a plush other that looks exactly like Ambrose. From his fur color, to his engineering suit. He has a grin on his face and is holding a wrench up in the air
[16:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I laugh and then with a mischevious grin place the Ambrose plushie down on all fours with you behind him to make it look like .... well you know
[16:19] Kire Brownback: he chukles a, then slides another box toward him. It's pretty flat
[16:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take off the lid carefully setting it aside. “And what do we have here hmm?”(edited)
[16:23] Kire Brownback: in side is an iron disk with the missions logo machined in it
[16:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I lift it up and check it out in different angles. Before putting it back down on the table. I get up from my seat and place a long lingering kiss on your lips my paw finding yours and giving it a soft squeeze. “Kire thank you really...”
[16:27] Kire Brownback: he smiles and squeezes your back still got one more hands him the last package. It looks a lot like the previous one(edited)
[16:29] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and sit back down opening the last black box.
[16:30] Kire Brownback: there is a very well made quilt that can fit a large king sized bed. On the middle of the quilt, is a picture of a grey cat spooning an otter(edited)
[16:31] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look up at you a single happy tear falling from my eye. Suddenly I look a little sullen. “I really don’t deserve you Kire...”
[16:33] Kire Brownback: he smiles and shakes his head we're gonna be gone for the rest of our lives out in space. We have been given a practically infinite budget to buy stuff to give us memories of of our system
[16:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I know but your so perfect....” he shrugs and gives him a hug again. “Thank you hun bun.”
[16:37] Kire Brownback: he smiles and holds you there happily I have more gifts coming, don't worry.
[16:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft laugh and give you another long needy kiss. A few seconds into the kiss the door opens and I jump apart from you blushing furiously. “Ermmm hullo doc?!” I say too loud and to suddenly
[16:40] Kire Brownback: blushes softly hello doc. We we're just meeting up is all he collets the items and puts them back in their respective boxes 

Doc she smiles at the pair don't worry, lovlies. It happens more then you would expect she has a very soothing and soft british accent(edited)
[16:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile up at her and blush. “yeah I’m sure it does.... so am I good to go?”
[16:43] Kire Brownback: she nods yep! Everything checks out ok! She grins softly at them
[16:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “So can I leave with him right now?” I ask excitedly my tail thumping heavily behind me.
[16:45] Kire Brownback: she giggles soon, but I need to ask Mr. Brownback some questions, first.
[16:48] Kire Brownback: kire's ears perk up yes ma'am, what do you wish to know?
[16:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sit back down and watch the exhnge slightly puzzled
16:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It’s come to my attention that you don’t have a surgeon on board is this correct?” She asks politely the female Dragon flicking her black tail as she asks her scales catching the light quite brilliantly.
[16:53] Kire Brownback: he nods we have a holographic medical assistant, and me and ambrose are both trained in first aid
[16:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she shakes her head slightly. “So what would happen if the power should fail and one or both of you were severely injured?”
[16:57] Kire Brownback: We have emergency battery backups in the medical bays, and we are currently working on a system that, if one or both of us fall unconscious, a drone would come to retrieve us(edited)
[17:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “And if you have to abandon ship? While wounded?” She asks politely. Sliding you a packet of papers which is very clearly her resume clearance codes and a commendation for saving lives in the “Aurora” incident where a deep space exploration team crashed on a foreign planet and survived for 3 years before rescue.
17:08] Kire Brownback: he frowns, and takes the packet I'll get back to you on it. What is your phone number? Pulls out his tablet, ready to make a note
[17:09] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she smiles and passes you her card
[17:09] Kire Brownback: he takes it and slides it in to the folder with the rest of the documents
11 October 2018
[01:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I hop up from the exam table and put everything back into their respective boxes. “So how about it Ki? Ready to abscond to our luxurious villa? And by that I mean our problem child of a ship?”
05:53] Kire Brownback: chukles and nods, taking his paw and leading him out, all of the documents and boxes in a bag
23:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: When we leave the room behind us and enter the elevator I turn to face you my eyes sparkling just a bit. “once we hit the ship and drop all this stuff off what do you want to do? The Orbius has so many different districts and things to do I’m sure we can find everything here.”(edited)
[23:48] Kire Brownback: he thinks for a bit, then gets a notification on his tablet well, it appears I'm needed at the Port. Hands him the ear piece he meant to give him later with this, you can talk to me if you need to smiles and kisses him see you in a bit, love. Kire walks off, going to do something else
[23:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I frown as you walk away and let out a sigh. “Welp time to go back to the ship I guess...” I mutter out and then shrug I grab the bag and head to the ship.
[23:52] Kire Brownback: kire heads to the main space dock, looking arround for a certain cannine with a clipboard
00:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The contractor stands around looking bored, clipboard hanging limply from a paw. The Doberman looks up and notices you walking towards him. “Are yous the Captains of the Peregrine?” His voice a surprisingly high tenor in a heavy French accent.(edited)
12 October 2018
[00:02] Kire Brownback: he nods yes I am. Are you Shane Miller? He puts his tablet away
[00:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yis dis is my name that’s correct.” He hands you the clipboard
[00:04] Kire Brownback: Good to meet you, Mr. Miller he takes out a pen and begins to look over the document this is for the refit and hydroponics, correct?
[00:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Oui we will be adding the hydroponics bay as well as additional living quarters for additional crew.” He points at each item as he says it on the clipboard. “We should be finished in about 4 days we have halted all other work to speed up your departure.”
[00:09] Kire Brownback: Take your time to inspect it all, Mr. Miller. We had many sensor failures just on our trip from Houston to here. He signs off on it thank you for your assistance on project DS(edited)
[00:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Trust me we are not those amateurs on Earth the Orbius shipyard has a 50 year track record of no malfunctions or errors, we will not tarnish it now.”
he saluted with pride taking the clipboard back.
[00:15] Kire Brownback: I hope you aren't using Chinese sensors, then. He turns arround and walks off, then calls ambrose
[00:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: It takes a few rings but I pick up the sound of power tools and industrial equipment in the background. “Hey, Hey, Hey get away from there! Yeah yeah yeah I’ll take a look at it.” after a small sigh I clear my throat. “This is Ambrose, sup?”
[00:19] Kire Brownback: Hey Ambrose, it's kire. How's things going over there? Begins to search for hotels where they could stay(edited)
[00:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Well I now know what 600 nuclear engineers look like in a single engine room.” I let out a chuckle softly “I’m just taking up space here these guys have PHD’s in things I’ve never even heard of. I already inspected the new sensors they are German and very high quality. What are you up too?”
[00:25] Kire Brownback: Just signed off on a refit of the living quarters and a hydroponics bay. Which means we are gonna be out of the ship for a few days. So start packing he clicks on a nice, 5 star hotel. Getting the top suite for 1 week I just got us a hotel to stay in
[00:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Roger I’m just going to grab my go bag want me to grab yours and meet you there?”
[00:29] Kire Brownback: Yes please. Just sent you the address. He begins to walk in that direction and don't worry, it's the top floor, best suite
[00:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Looking forward to it.” Grunting can be heard as I grab both of the large duffels and grab my tablet. “Got the address grabbing a cab and heading there now see you when I get there love.”
[00:36] Kire Brownback: You too, love he hangs up just as he arrives, then waits in the lobby for Ambrose to arrive
[00:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I arrive 10 minutes after stepping out of a sky cab quickly and grabbing the bags before it zips off again joining more of the traffic floating through the space port. “Hey Ki swanky place you’ve booked us.” I say as I look around approvingly handing you your bag. When I hand you your bag I give you a soft quick peck. “I was hoping for some time with you just the two of us. Feels like years since we just got to talk.”
[00:41] Kire Brownback: he nods and kisses your neck just been busy. Tommorow we'll have plenty of time to shop and cuddle he takes his paw and goes up to the front desk
[00:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grip your paw and walk up to the counter a light blush across my muzzle
[00:42] Kire Brownback: Hi, I believe I ordered a room recently? We're currently getting our ship renovated he smiles at the desk hologram attendent(edited)
[00:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The Attractive pink Female rabbit working the front. Takes one look at us holding hands and gives you a beaming smile. “Ahhhh yes you must be Mr. Brownback and your plus one? The suite is available now here are your room keys.” She says all this cheerfully handing us a wristband each. “The keys also carry a holographic map of the entirety of the Orbius as well as reference material involving the station and any activities you may want, think about it as a personal concierge free of charge of course.”
[00:48] Kire Brownback: he take the guard and hands a key to Ambrose thank you. We will definitely be using these. Do i need to sign anything before we can leave for our suite?
[00:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “No sir everything had already been paid in advance by your organization. You two have a wonderful time at Frump Tower.” she says happily with a little wave before ushering you into the private elevator that leads to the suite.
[00:52] Kire Brownback:he holds onto his paw tight as he walks into the elevator
00:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: *I enter the elevator with you and give you a loving smile as the doors close. “You look, absolutely lovely darling.” I finally say after just standing there look at you for the first few floors (Only meant for the reference to be humorous  never meant to offend)
[00:58] Kire Brownback: he smiles back down at you and I love you just as much, my love leans down and kisses you softly
[01:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I drop my bag in the elevator floor and use my arm to pull you in by the waist my kiss is passionate and urgent.
[01:01] Kire Brownback: he moans softly, embracing you and holding you tight, breaking it just as the door opens after you, my love
[01:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod pulling away from you and picking up my bag my paw finding yours before intertwining my digits with yours.
[01:02] Kire Brownback: he follows behind the otter in the the suite that appears to be more of a mini mansion wow...
[01:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My mouth literally drops as I stroll out of the elevator. “Ummmmm key ring thing open up a floor plan so I can our room.” a map popping up a moment later. I point to the bedroom and start walking there towing you behind me as I eye the marble walls and just the sheer luxury of it all. When we get to the room I open the door and let out a low whistle the middle of the room is dominated by a giant California king sized bed with nice furniture and a full kitchen in the bedroom. “Holy shit...”
[01:09] Kire Brownback: Jesus Christ.... This must cost 100k a day to rent... God I'm glad NASA is paying for this and not us. *He drops his bag by the door looking arround and up and down the entire room. This is bigger then the room on our ship... Even fighting the warehouse...
[01:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah, and its all ours too. No AVA no alarms just you and me.” I say turning around to face you slowly
[01:11] Kire Brownback: smirks, then grabs your crotch, feeling your chastity cage but don't you remember? Hmm... Maybe I should tease you by tying you down and masturbating on to your tiny little head
[01:15] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I pull your hand away and hug you hard burying my face into your neck. My breathing turning slightly ragged a soft sob wrenching from my throat as my happy mask finally crumbles away. “I thought I was going to leave you... I-I’m So Sorry Kire.” I cry into your neck my tears wetting down your fur.
[01:18] Kire Brownback: he gasps, not expecting him to break into tears, but he embraces him happily. He begins to pick up the otter and bringing him over to the giant bed it's ok dear. We risk our lives in the pursuit of science. And if you lost your life, you would be honored as a very brave otter, out here in otter space
[01:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a weak chuckle at the joke. “I know... I’m sorry, I just need you right now...” With that my lips find yours and press against them urgently paws pressing your body into mine.
[01:25] Kire Brownback: he kisses you back happily, holding your body against his closely(edited)
[01:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My lips slowly grow more heated against yours my paw finding yours and guiding it back against my caged cock. “Mmmhhmm~”
[01:29] Kire Brownback: rubs the area just arround the cage no matter what you do to me, I'm not locking this until we undock. Finds your balls, beginning to massage then softly
[01:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a soft moan as you massage my softly furred balls. “H-hah I know...”
[01:31] Kire Brownback: smiles and looks at the clock. 3pm. We still got plenty of time.. wanna take a nap, get dinner, and then go shopping?
[01:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I don’t answer instead my paw gently strokes your sheath through your clothing my paws pace slow and steady against your sheath.
[01:34] Kire Brownback: he moans softly, then grabs your paw and pulls it away not right now, ok?
01:36] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look up at you Slightly annoyed but nod. “Fineeee.” I say pulling my hands away from your sheath.
[06:51] Kire Brownback: smiles and kisses your forehead thanks, dear. Smiles and starts to purr softly, holding you close against my body
07:29] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I press my lips against yours before rolling over and presenting my back for you to spoon. “Nap time?”
[07:30] Kire Brownback: he nods, slowly sliding the comforter over us it's always a good time for napping
09:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a chuckle and press my butt against your front before I let out a yawn
[09:23] Kire Brownback: closes his eyes, still purring and holding Ambrose close, quickly falling asleep
[09:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Your soft purring lulls me to sleep quickly soft snores leaving my muzzle.
[09:31] Kire Brownback: a couple of minutes later an alarm goes off in kire's earpiece. He tries to shush it but it doesn't work, so he slowly slides away from the otter, being extra extra carful not to wake him
09:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a grumble and curl up into a tighter ball my paws reaching for you, finding nothing and gripping the comforter instead.
09:39] Kire Brownback: he walks out of the room what is it... Yes I know... B-... Sighs so how big of a delay is it? Rubs his temples slowly 2 weeks... Alright... No, don't buy it from China. Ambrose will be really mad about that.... Well, thanks for telling me at least... Have a good day. He ends the call, and sits down on the plush, letting out a groan
[09:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: You can here a groan and a low whine from the bedroom as I wake up to find you gone.
[09:43] Kire Brownback: he stands up and walks back in, going over to Ambrose sleep, dear. I'm just dealing with some stuff, ok?
[09:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: when you enter the room you can see me struggling with the chastity belt my morning wood throbbing inside of it restrained. “Mmmmm!” I groan my paws yanking at the lock
[09:46] Kire Brownback: he sighs and goes over to him, mutters something, then producing a key stay still and I'll let you out
[09:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stop yanking at the lock my eyes watching  the keys every move.
[09:48] Kire Brownback: he puts the key in the lock and turns it, unlocking the lock
[09:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: With the lock unlocked my chastity belt nearly pops off with the strength of my erection and immediate moan of relief issuing from me. “Hah much better.”
[09:51] Kire Brownback: smiles and grabs your paw go relive your self in the shower, please. Don't wanna get this bed dirty he goes over to his bag and looks arround, starting at one thing for a couple of moments, then shaking his head and zipping up his bag
[09:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I come up behind you and press you into a hug my lips kissing your neck gently. “Come take a shower with me baby and tell me what’s got you so bothered.”
[09:55] Kire Brownback: he shake his head and grabs his tablet I can't, hunny. I'm sorry... He walks out of the bed room, going to the couch and typing in his tablet, looking extremely stressed
[10:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I follow behind you your stressed expression making me forget all about my need for release. I stand in front of you arms crossed and when you stay looking and typing at your tablet I pull it from your hands and lay it aside sinking to my knees right in front of you so we are at eye level our muzzles inches apart. “Kire, please don’t shut me out what’s going on?” My ears are pinned back against my fur showing that I’m worried. “I love you Kire and I want to be there for you and I want you here for me.”
[10:01] Kire Brownback: he sighs you know the warp drive, right? I just got a call from the contractor who is building it... Sets his head in his paws
[10:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod one of my paws resting on your lower thigh rubbing gently in a coaxing manner. “Mhhhmmm? And what did he say.”
[10:04] Kire Brownback: The machine they are using to make the coils... The most advanded an precise one on Earth....just broke down... And it's going to take 2 more weeks for it to be finished
[10:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a morbid chuckle. “Well it seems like I’m going to be wearing this for awhile longer huh?” I let out a sigh and relock the cage around my still semi hard member. “Kire don’t let the delays bother you there’s nothing we can do about it... and it’s not going to look bad on us.”(edited)
[11:01] Kire Brownback: he sighs and looks at him hun... Hands him the key take it off.... I'm sorry about that stupid little thing... I was really horny and not thinking about your or your safety...(edited)
13 October 2018
[00:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I cross arms over my chest and let out a huff and hands you the key back “And I still thank its hot and like I said before.... I’m not a quitter. Now cheer up Kire that means we get two weeks to explore the Orbius and get anything we need done.”
[09:01] Kire Brownback: No... Holds it out for you keep it. It's best that you have it so if your ever in pain from it, you can unlock yourself..(edited)
[10:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take the key and hold out my paw to you. “Come back to bed, please?”
[10:47] Kire Brownback: he sighs and closes his eyes, thinking for a couple of moments, then opens his eyes and takes your paw of course, my love
[10:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I guide you back to the bed and lay down next to you so that I’m facing you. “Your stress levels have been really high Kire I’m worried it’s like you take each little setback personally. When they definitely can’t be helped.”
[10:54] Kire Brownback: he nods I know... It's just... Sighs and hangs his head I'm the commander of this mission. I know the position of every ship that is carrying parts for our ship. I have talked to every contractor. I know the minute detail of their travel path, and have made accurate estimates down to the second... And this throws those estimations out the window...
[10:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “And? Fuck the estimates they ship will be done when it’s done. I don’t want to see you driven to madness because for some reason you think everything’s your fault. Plus you been looking a little grey than usual.” I say running a paw through the soft fur of your stomach, slowly going lower and lower until it gently rests on your sheath. “I kiss you on the lips gently then move my lips to your ear* “I’m going to relieve some of that stress for you hun and don’t you dare say no.”
[11:00] Kire Brownback: he nods slowly, then closes his eyes and lays down on his back, spreading his legs for you
[11:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My paw begins to gently massage your sheath my other paw slowly playing with each of your balls.
[11:02] Kire Brownback: he moans softly, moving a bit to get more comfy
[11:04] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Your moan brings a soft smile to my face and Kiss you hard on the lips and slowly kiss my way down your body until my lips kiss the opening of your sheath my tongue swirling against its opening.
[11:04] Kire Brownback: he moans louder, his cock starting to slide out of his sheath
[11:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: When your cock starts to slide out I gently take the head into my mouth sucking lightly while my paw starts to speed up its rubbing on your sheath.
[11:09] Kire Brownback: his cock let's out a tiny bit of pre into the otters mouth as more and more of his meat reveals it's self
[11:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: lick your tip clean of pre before I take your shaft into my mouth and slowly start to bob on it while adding just a bit of suction.(edited)
[11:13] Kire Brownback: he moans louder, his base starting to throb very slightly
[11:15] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I slam my mouth down to your throbbing base my eyes tearing up when I do but I start to Bob faster and faster on your cock doing my best to deep throat you but having to come up for air every few seconds.
[11:17] Kire Brownback: he wiggles a bit, holding back the urge to cum, his legs tensing up
[11:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I feel you move under me and I pull off your dick with a pop admiring the hard length. “where would you rather finish in my mouth or in my ass?” I say with a giggle waggling my ass behind be when I say ass.
[01:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I think for a moment before nodding a smile on my face my tongue starting to lap up and down your hard cock. “Mmmmmhhmhm didn’t know you were such a dirty kitten.”
[05:58] Kire Brownback: he giggles a bit not as dirty a-as you, forci-ing a bl-low job on  me
[23:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My tablets alarm goes off promptly at 6am I shootout of bed and start to put on my working coveralls. “Kire wake up we got shit to do.” My voice is in it usual pre coffee grumpy mumble.
[23:55] Kire Brownback: he gumbles, curling into a cat ball slowly I don't wanna...
[23:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: ((You wouldn’t be offended if I posted in looking for ERP would you? I really love this RP and really want to continue the plot and our little universe that we are building but I also use rp as my only source of arousing material could never get into porn much to fabricated and I value creativity and imagination most when looking for arousing material.))
[23:58] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I go over to the sink and pour a glass of water turning back to face you. “Wake up kitty or you’ll wake up wet.”
23:59] Kire Brownback: (oh not at all. You do you, man. Just tell me if you ever get bored of this RP so we can figure out how to properly end this... Which will probably be in a couple of years lol) he whines louder, slinking under comforter
00:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug and go to your side of the bed and pull the covers off dumping the entire glass all over your grey fur.
[00:03] Kire Brownback: he gasps as he feels the first drop his his fur, jerking away from the rest of the water fine, fine. I'll get up he gets out of bed and wraps him self up in a blanket
[00:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a grunt of aknowledgement and finish getting dressed and begin lick my paws and running the over my shirt curly hair trying to fix the snarled mane of my hair.
[00:10] Kire Brownback: he goes over to the shower and begins to wash up, eventually just sitting down on the shower floor and thinking about what has happened in their adventure so far
[00:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I get a notification on my tablet and let out a soft sigh. No rest for the Head engineer after all. I walk to the bathroom and open the door looking at you in the shower with a single raised eyebrow. “Hey I’ve got to run babe I’m going to the spaceport to oversee the remodel and additional crew quarters you should probably go and get some crew to fill them I’ll probably meet back here with you tonight unless you swing by sometime.”
[00:14] Kire Brownback: he nods and stands up I will. Probably gonna hire that doctor we met yesterday. Any support crew you need? Begins to do a thorough cleaning of his fur
[00:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I could use some skilled workers to do non critical systems I’ll look at the handiwork of those I work with and give you several recommendations.
[00:17] Kire Brownback: he nods what's are max crew after the renovations? Stands under the rain style shower head to get the sudds out of his fur
[00:19] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Single bunking 3 unless others don’t mind sharing a rack like us.”
[00:20] Kire Brownback: he nods so you basically just need an assistant engineer? Turns the shower off and faces him
[00:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug already typing work orders into my tablet. “yeah one or two wouldn’t be bad.”
[00:22] Kire Brownback: Got it he steps out of the showrr and starts to dry off
[00:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I finish typing into my tablet and lean in to give you a kiss a free paw gently resting on your chest “See you around Mr. man.”
[00:25] Kire Brownback: he kisses you back goodbye, my love. Smiles at him good luck
[00:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give you a quick slap on the ass “That’s for good luck hopefully you have a better day than yesterday.”
[00:27] Kire Brownback: he giggles a bit you too, Hun. Wraps himself up in a towel and heads back to their room(edited)
[00:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I leave the hotel suit and head towards the airport.
[00:35] Kire Brownback: kire gets dressed and gets himself some breakfast, then sits down on the couch, beginning to look through Jeannine's resume
[00:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Her resume is simply perfect her medical expertise shows extensive training and research into unknown undiscovered diseases. She also has amazing reports  from her time during the aurora incident.
[00:39] Kire Brownback: he makes a few notes here and there on the papers, then sends her a message, inviting her here for an interview(edited)
[00:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A quick response comes in saying she has a break in two hours.
[00:41] Kire Brownback: he acknowledges that with a simple "k" then begins to do some reading to pass the time
[15:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The Allotted time arrives and you hear two sharp knocks on the door.
[15:16] Kire Brownback: he stands up and puts his book down, heading for the door to open it. he is wearing a t-shirt and jeans. He enters the door with a smile hello there, jeneanine. Good to see you today
[15:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Her smile is likewise dazzling and she enters the open doorway. “I see that you’ve given thought to my request.”
[15:32] Kire Brownback: he nods and leads her to the couch I have, and have somethings to ask you he picks up his tablet also, this conversation is going to be recorded, and shared between me and Ambrose if it is needed, otherwise it will be deleted at the end of this interview, got it? He sits down in a chair
[15:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She follows you over to the couch and sits down on it when offered. “I think that’s its good if you to include your mate, errr shipmate I mean, in decisions. It shows you’re a fair captain, so by all means please record me.”
[15:38] Kire Brownback: he nods alright, according to your resume, you have a masters in first aid, psychiatry, emergency first, and a PhD in diagnosis and surgery. Is that correct?
[15:41] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She smile nodding. “Yes and I’ve held professions in each for at least 5 years outside of school.”
[15:42] Kire Brownback: he notes that have you ever had to do a emergency operation, be it surgery or first aid in space or in a zero g environment?
[15:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I was the on board medic on the Aurora whenever she went down. I have to much experience working on crewman in space and 0G enviroments.”(edited)
[15:48] Kire Brownback: he makes a lot of that as well now, time for some scenarios. You are on a small ship used for transferring good from one ship to another. There is only a minor first aid kit on the ship, and you are in the ship as the medic. An engineer gets a large cut on their upper left arm about 6 inches long. How do you react to this situation?
[15:50] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I would use the first aid kit to clean the wound and then find a tool box to use monofilament line to stitch the wound. In an emergency it can be used as a replacement.” she reaches for a glass of water on a table and takes a small drink from it.
[15:52] Kire Brownback: Alright. You are in the same ship two hour later and the captian has been stabbed with a knife in his gut, leaving a hole that is about 4 inches in diameter. The person who stabbed him has been taken into custody. How do you react to this situation?
[15:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I would use quick clot from the first aid kit and try to stop the bleeding as we head to the nearest medical facility if none was available then perhaps emergency cauterization of the wound it may damage some nerves but it might save the life.”(edited)
[15:55] Kire Brownback: he makes a note of her response to the last two situations alright. Now, other then the fact that we don't have any other medical staff, why do you wish to join my crew?
[15:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she readjusts her black skirt and crosses her legs. When she looks back up at you her eyes are deadly serious. “My last deep space exploration mission ended abruptly and in disaster I want another shoot to get out there and into the black.”
[15:59] Kire Brownback: he gulps and notes that alright. What was the reason that your previous mission failed, unless that information is confidential
[15:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It’s confidential.”
[16:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: her tone indicates that this conversation was over.
[16:01] Kire Brownback: he notes that alright, he puts his tablet down* how much do you know about my ship, so I know what to tell you
[16:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she pulls out something from her dress jacket a folder with full schematics of your ship as well as a mission briefing. “And before you ask yes I have clearance for this.”
[16:07] Kire Brownback: he blinks at her how did you even get clearance to this? It's a priv- he pauses, and then shakes his head nevermind, I know how you got clearance. So I'm assuming you have looked over the schematic completly?
[16:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She nods taking the folder back from your paws. “yes and went over both of your files and detailed medical records as well.”
[16:13] Kire Brownback: he nods, then pulls out a cube and press a button on the side. The lights dim as a 3D hologram of the ship appears above the box this is a much more detailed version of the schematics the hologram is in full color, slowly spinning horizontally
[16:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She gazed at the ship schematics with only a slight bit of interest. “So Captain Brownback mind if you answer some questions?”
[16:53] Kire Brownback: he nods yes, of course. he picks up his tablet and begins to type something into it. then the hologram changes. its now a view of the main deck, crew quarters, and the 3 med bays
[16:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “What would you do if your ship were to crash on an uninhabited and uncharted world with no hope for escape?”
[16:58] Kire Brownback: he is silent for a couple of moments go arround the ship to make sure my crew is ok. make sure they get out first. if my ship goes down... he gulps then ill go down with it
[17:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She nods after a few moments of thinking. “What would you do if the only way to save the ship and everyone on it was to do an action in which your lover would most certainly be killed?
[17:02] Kire Brownback: he sets his tablet down on the table, gulping and thinking for a couple of long seconds i would ask ambrose what need to be done in order to save the ship... closes his eyes and then go and do it myself, if it my life ending... lets out a sigh i know every single function and wiring conduit of the ship... im not gonna let it go down... i want to pass it on to future generations....
[17:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Interesting But it’s my understand that he has lockout controls doesn’t he? What if he doesn’t let you? Could you kill your lover?”
[17:18] Kire Brownback: he nods he does have lockout controls to a certain extent. but as the captain, i can overwrite any lockouts.. and could i kill him.... he is silent for about 10 seconds, tears starting to form in his eyes no...
[17:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “You see where that might be a promblem?”
[17:37] Kire Brownback: he shakes his head slowly no... i dont honestly... sits down in the chair and wipes the tears away from his eyes i value others life over my own.... and i would no doubt donate blood, but i have a major phobia of needles, and almost pass out when i have to give even a milliliter of blood...
[17:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She nods and shakes her head as if to shake out bad memories. “Hopefully we will never have any of these scenarios happen.”
[17:54] Kire Brownback: he nods as well but we still have to prepare for them, if needed. he lets out a sigh and is quiet for a few seconds anyway, on to a different subject he stands up and highlights the three medical bays we have 3 main areas for medical. one is currently unused, and we were thinking of changing into a surgical center. what would you need for that room?
[19:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She pulls out a list of medical supplies in the same folder and hands it over. “I anticipated you might want a full list of supplies each has the exact model number as to my specifications
[20:03] Kire Brownback: he looks through the list quickly alright. He sets this down on the table, then brings up a list of the things they have in their other two med bays, and a list of the medical supplies they currently have and hands it to her this is a current list of our medical supplies, and the items in the other two other medical bays. Any notes you have on them?
[20:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She looks through the list briefly. I have had experience with most of this list and it’s decent equipment if you send me it I’ll research the rest.”
[20:27] Kire Brownback: he nods will do he takes the tablet back so... Presses a few buttons, bringing up a legal document, and hands it back to her will you join the mission to explore our universe? It is a contract for her hiring you would be greatly appreciated, and a hero to earth and all fur kind
[20:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Of course but I’m not out here for the recognition I’m just here to keep everyone healthy.”
[20:35] Kire Brownback: smiles and points to a line at the bottom of the document sign here, and you are officially a crew member on the Peregrine
[20:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she uses one of her long perfectly manicured nails to sign the document her writing is long violent slashes.
[20:38] Kire Brownback: he sets the tablet down, then stands up and holds out a paw welcome, Dr. Jeneanine, to the crew of Peregrine. Smiles at her
[20:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she takes you paw and gives it 3 quick pumps
[20:41] Kire Brownback: he stands at attention we will be departing in approximately 4 to 5 weeks time. If you wish, you may stay with me and Ambrose here. Your flight suit and tablet will be ready by tomorrow morning(edited)
[20:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She pops a crisp salute back and shakes her head. “That won’t be necessary I have a place here in the Orbius and I need to get my affairs in order before I leave.”
[20:46] Kire Brownback: he nods well, I hope that you will at least stay here 1 week before departure. During that time we will go over final inspections and emergency proceders, along with our mission and everything in our cargo hold(edited)
[21:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Send me a message on my tablet whenever we are one week from departure and I will be here promptly.”
[21:01] Kire Brownback: he nods got it. Anything else you want to note to me?
[21:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m married with 50 children.” She holds a poker face then bursts out laughing. “Just kidding!”
[21:04] Kire Brownback: he nods that's good. Knowing that your a doctor, I would imagine that you would use protection
[21:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Well not all the time then it wouldn’t be fun.” she does an abrupt about face and walks from the hotel room.
[21:06] Kire Brownback: he relaxes as she leaves good luck, and see you in a while(edited)
[21:15] Ambrosia fluffbutt: she waves to you without turning back closing the door behind her.
[21:19] Kire Brownback: he let's out a sigh as he sits back down in the chair, then texts Ambrose they she just hired on to the crew
[23:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: As soon as you send the message an automatic do not disturb message gets sent to you apparently Ambrose was busy overseeing the refit in the ship.
[23:42] Kire Brownback: he sighs and then orders jeneanine's flight suit and tablet, along with the equipment she wants for the surgical room. After that is done, he goes back to reading his book, the hotel room silent
[23:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: After a few minutes your tablet starts to buzz the screen lighting up with my profile pic of me making a ridiculous face that I must have snuck on your device to take.
[23:44] Kire Brownback: he smiles and answers the call, putting his book down hello there, dear
[23:49] Ambrosia fluffbutt: In the background you can hear the sound of construction in the background and the beeping of lifts reversing. “I saw that you hired on the good doctor how did her interview go babe.”
[23:50] Kire Brownback: It went pretty well. I do have the audio recording of it, if you want it. But... We did talk about some pretty disturbing things... Including d-death
[23:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yeah it makes since seeing as she’s a doctor. So is she going to be staying in the suite or somewhere else?” The sounds of chattering grow louder then pass as a work crew passes by me off on break. “Sorry it’s so loud babe there’s more workers here than necessary but we are already ahead of schedule.”
[23:55] Kire Brownback: he nods don't worry. And she is gonna be staying at her home, until the last week before we depart. He stands up and begins to work on the surgical center I'm also designing a new surgical room for her, based on an equipment list she gave me.
20 October 2018
[10:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Ummm we are kinda pressed from room as it is. Is it in the cargo bay? If it is I’ll stop work until you have the new dimensions drafted up.” The noise in the background seems to die off completely as we talk.
[10:33] Kire Brownback: presses a button on his tablet I just sent you the new schematics for it. Email her if you have any questions on it. I'm also gonna be heading over to the ship soon. Powers down the hologram cube
[10:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A few moments pass before a notification goes off and you hear me say. “I got it, and now is a good time to come back everyone else is on break.”
[10:37] Kire Brownback: Alright, be over there soon, Hun. Want me to bring you anything? I'm gonna be stopping by Mc-fila on my way there he begins to put his shoes on
[10:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m good with just the protein shakes. I’ll see you when you get here though.”
[10:47] Kire Brownback: Alright, see you later, love he ends the call, then leaves the hotel room and makes his way toward the ship
[10:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: When you get close to the ships berth you see me waiting outside I look up from my tablet and run to you throwing you into a giant hug and kissing you full on the lips. “Glad you could make it out babe.”
[10:52] Kire Brownback: he gasps an kisses you back happily I'm glad your out here supervising it he has a bag from Mc-fila I bought you some nuggets just in case you want them(edited)
[11:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I kiss you hard one more time squeezing you gently before letting you go. “Come on you know I wouldn’t let anyone touch our kid without supervision.”
[11:07] Kire Brownback: he giggles I know, Hun. Let's just hope they haven't dug too deep into the cargo hold yet(edited)
[11:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I frown slightly “Well we already kinda put the walls up for the room configuration today soo we will probably have to tear that all down again.”
[11:12] Kire Brownback: he nods alright. Have there been any road blocks recently in the construction?
11:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: He shakes his head no. “Everything has been going according to plan and until the new cargo bay specs we haven’t hit any roadblocks at all we were ahead of schedule today.
[11:16] Kire Brownback: he nods if we need more space, we can order a new cargo pod to attach to our ship he pulls out the Hologram cube and brings up the schematic for the ship
[11:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “No I refuse. The extra cargopod layout was just a theory one that is untested. We have no idea how it might effect flight characteristics or the FTL drive.” I say this with my arms crossed in a that’s final expression.
[11:19] Kire Brownback: he nods, good point sets the cube down on a table and expands the view so it is bigger and takes up the entire table(edited)
[11:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take a look at the projection and wait for your briefing.
[11:28] Kire Brownback: So this is what out ship looks like currently, with out the hydroponics bays and FTL ring. Presses a button on his tablet, and the ship now has the hydroponics bays and ring this is it with the hydroponics and ring. Brings up the main deck, before and after the renovations and here is the difference with the main deck. the weight of the surgeical center shouldnt change much
[11:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I agree the final parts of the FTL ring will be getting here tomorrow and they we will begin installation the day after after all parts go through final inspection.”
[11:43] Kire Brownback: Good. I'm gonna be here when it gets installed, cause that costs more then staying a year in our hotel room
[11:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a chuckle. “Hell that thing is almost as much as our ship.”
[11:50] Kire Brownback: he nods really he sits down at the table and takes out the two things of nuggets
[11:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grab one of the things of nuggets and pop one in my mouth. “Don’t want one to go to waste and when is the next time we will have then?”
[11:54] Kire Brownback: he chukles well whenever we want it since we have those matter reconfigureators
[11:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I roll my eyes and punch you in the shoulder jokingly cmon man you know those things don’t make perfect copies they just don’t have that same great taste.
[11:57] Kire Brownback: True, true. He smiles and puts an arm arround you
[12:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I likewise place an arm around you and give you a small peck on the cheek. “Last chance to quit to stay here and start a life with each other.” I say in a tone that was only half joking.
[12:02] Kire Brownback: chukles we can still start a life up in space. And the farther away from earth we go, the closer we get to each other
[15:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take your paw gently and raise it up to give it a single tender kiss. “You’re right Kire, like always... I can’t wait for us to start our life out there deep in the black.”
[15:24] Kire Brownback: he smiles and kisses you softly, purring quietly now the only thing holding us back now, is our ship. He squeezes your paw
[15:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It’ll be done soon love.” I say kissing you back with fervor. My tongue gently entering your mouth and making a quick swipe of your tongue before pulling back away. Already the work crews starting to trickle in to the work area.(edited)
[15:49] Kire Brownback: smiles at him, looking a tiny bit flushed if only I could make time go by faster. But when ever I'm arround you it seems to slow.
[15:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a chuckle and adjust my tool belt. “Why don’t you just hibernate till it’s done, I’ll get shit done faster with you not hovering.” I say winking obviously joking as I start to walk back to the ship to continue work.
[15:54] Kire Brownback: smiles and stands up I might as well, my love. Kire walks back to the hotel, laying down in bed, and then wrapping him self up in the covers and falling asleep
16:11] Kire Brownback: by now 5 weeks has passed, the ship has passed all of the testing and inspections, and the crew had gone over the procedures. They are now boarding the ship, with a a large group of press recording them as the door closes
22 October 2018
[10:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: When the bulkhead closes I let out a relieved sigh and cross my arms over my chest. “I don’t know about you two but I’m so glad that we are underway. And I hate the press.”
[12:35] Kire Brownback: kire nods, leaning forawrd and kissing Ambrose on the cheek it's nice until they start asking questions about our relationship jeneanine heads toward her room and starts to set things up
[19:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile as you kiss me and kiss your cheek in return. “What you think we were being a little to obvious or something?”
[19:09] Kire Brownback: shrugs I do think they got a bit suspicious when you were rubbing my leg on stage he goes to the cockpit and starts to boot up the systems(edited)
[19:10] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I blush and turn to head back to engineering to start the engines and crank up the reactor gain. “It was with my tail I thought it wouldn’t be obvious.”
[19:12] Kire Brownback: They're always watching, Hun. You should know that
AVA good morning everyone. How was your break
A screech is heard from jeneanine's room
[19:14] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stop looking back at you with s raised eyebrow. “Heyyyyy hun..... you did tell Jeanine about AVA right?”
[19:15] Kire Brownback: he blushes a bit I think I did.... Umm.. he yells the the general direction of her room sorry about that, jeneanine!
[19:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I walk back to engineering quickly going through the preflight procedures and activating the main drive engines. After several minutes you hear my voice come in crisply on the intercom. “Alright babe you’re good to slip on out of the Orbius.”
[19:19] Kire Brownback: Noted. Ava, get us out of orbius flight yard and a safe distance away for us to go to warp 1
[19:22] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The peregrine slips silkily from its berth as it heads through the opening back into the inky black of space. One the rear slips through the opening you can feel the ship gracefully spin and rotate, lining with a new bearing to send us past all commercial shipping routes.
[19:33] Kire Brownback: he sits back and relaxes, watching the outside as it moves(edited)
[19:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The ship easily slips past the shipping lanes after 15 minutes of smooth sailing the calm pleasant sound of AVA’s voice announcing “We have passed all commercial shipping lanes your are now cleared to for FTL travel.”
[19:40] Kire Brownback: Noted, Ava. Standby for further FTL instruction. All staff please report to cockpit for discussion on further travel
[19:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Jeneanine comes to the cockpit followed shortly after me. Both of us stand beside your chair on either side. 

Jeneanie “What did you want to discuss?”(edited)
[19:45] Kire Brownback: he pulls up a 3d map where who we want to go? We have practically the entire universe at our paws(edited)
[19:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: We both lean in towards the map and briefly look at it. Finally after a few moments silence I chime in. “How about the horsehead nebula? If we are going to do this we might as well go all the way.”
[19:48] Kire Brownback: he nods but do you really wanna be traveling for 500 years? That's at our maximum safe speed
19:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “How about Proxima Centauri then?”
[19:53] Kire Brownback: he nods alright. He does some quick math everyone here ok with sleeping for a bit over a year while we travel there?
[19:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Jeneanie shrugs and gives a wide smile. “Isn’t that what we are here for? To venture forth to stars unknown?” 

Ambrose “You know I don’t care how long it takes as long as it’s here with you.”(edited)
[19:57] Kire Brownback: he smiles and nuzzles Ambrose sounds good. To me. Everyone get into positions for 0 to wrap 1 to warp 3. Ava prepare for for warp 1 to warp 3. Go on my cue
[20:01] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I leave for the engineering room yet again and setup the engines for warp travel. “All Good here go for it.”

Jeneanie “I’m in my chair I guess that’s my position” You can hear her chuckles coming in over the intercom.
[20:04] Kire Brownback: he nods everyone brace for warp 1. Once we reach wrap 3 and everything has stabilized, we can stand up and do things. Ava, are we clear to go for warp 1?
[20:19] Ambrosia fluffbutt: AVA “All clear still.” He tone almost seemed a little annoyed
[20:21] Kire Brownback: Noted. Go for warp 1 to warp 3 in 3... 2... 1.... Go presses the big red button on his console(edited)
[20:29] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The ship barely shudders as the blast shields close over the cockpit. After a few seconds AVA announces “Warp 1 achieved accelerating to warp 2 then 3.”
[20:30] Kire Brownback: kire keeps his eyes on the graphs, finger trained the on the abort button just in case the levels get too high
[20:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Everything runs smoothly for once everything staying well within safe level

AVA “Warp two achieved.”
[20:40] Kire Brownback: 10/4, keep going. He gulps. For once it isn't in flames
[20:44] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The ships stops its vibrating right as AVA says cooly. “Congratulations on breaking the new speed record warp 3 achieved.”
[20:45] Kire Brownback: kire let's out a long sigh of relief, muttering "fuck yes" under his breath many many many times
[20:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Ship in stable trajectory I will minister for anything that requires crew adjustment you are free to move about the cabin.” AVA jokes speaking like an old commercial airliner pilot before they were replaced with autonomous aircraft.
[20:49] Kire Brownback: kire stands up thank you, Ava. Crew you are dismissed to do what ever you want. Kire walks back to his and Ambroses room, stripping almost instantly
[20:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: It takes me nearly 5 minutes before I arrive and when I do my coveralls are already hanging off my chest. “Kire we did it!!!”
[20:54] Kire Brownback: he is waiting by the side of the door and tackle hugs Ambrose, smothering him in kisses I know I know! He squeals in happinesses 
20:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out an audible oof as you connect with me but I let out a laugh and start peppering your face with kisses. “This is what we are out here for! To break records and to go where no fur has gone before.”
[20:59] Kire Brownback: he giggles and lifts you on to the bed, slipping your overalls off completly to see what are telescopes could never see before. And to fuck like no fur had fucked before
[21:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a laugh as the coveralls slip off revealing me in a bulging pink pair of panties the chastity cafe clearly defined under the thin fabric. “You’re damned right about that.”
[21:03] Kire Brownback: he laughs and slowly take your panties off* now where is that key for that lock? Holds up the lock that holds the cage closed
[21:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Hmmm maybe they are in otter space?” * I say with a laugh adjusting my hips so you can see my tailhole that has a key ring clearly visible.* “Why else did you think I took so long.”
[21:34] Kire Brownback: he laughes, leaning down and grabbing the key in how mouth setting it on your belly hmm... Maybe I should leave you locked up like this while I play with your cute lil' butt
[21:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My ears press back as I scowl at your head between my legs. “Not even funny Kire.” You can already see my erection straining in the cage pre dripping from the slot on the tip.
[21:38] Kire Brownback: he giggles alright, alright he picks up the key and unlocks the cage, throwing it behind himself now your freeeee
[21:40] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My shaft springs straight up when it releases my face assuming a heavenly expression “Ooooh yes~” I moan loudly my cock still slightly bobbing in the air.
[21:43] Kire Brownback: he giggles and slowly licks your member from it's base to it's tip, watching your expression
[21:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My eyes close tightly when your tongue swipes over my shaft my paws gripping the sheets of the bed. “Ooh Gods that’s amazing...”
[21:50] Kire Brownback: he smiles and softly sucks on your tip, his paws sliding forward and rubbing and and tweaking your nipples
[21:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock jumps in your soft maw my paws leaving the sheets to gently stroke the grey fur on the back of your head. “I~I’m already close Kire~”
[21:53] Kire Brownback: he smiles and pulls his mourher off, angling the cock towards his face and slowly stroking you from your tip to your base with his paw, mouth hanging open slightly
[21:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My cock jumps hard in your paw when I realize your intentions the first spurt of cum hitting you right above your eyelid with many more spurting all over your face nearly taking 30 seconds before I stop cumming. “I think my soul just came out mmmhmm~” Surprisingly my cock still waves in the air still fully erect.
[22:00] Kire Brownback: he giggles and opens his mouth wide, catching a bit of cum in his mouth, his face blushing and covered in cum well it's all over me, which makes it better he rubs his cum-coverd head against your chest and neck
[22:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I giggle and let out a happy laugh. “C’mere baby let Brosie clean up your face.”
[22:07] Kire Brownback: he giggles and sets his head down on his chest, smiling and bleping very slightly
[22:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I sit up licking off all my mess before pressing my lips to yours pressing my cum covered tongue into your hot mouth.
[22:15] Kire Brownback: he moans very quietly, interweiving his tounge with yours and closing his eyes, holding your head against his
[22:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My tongue battles with yours for dominance before finally letting yours win. “We’ve been so busy lately we needed this...” I murmur when I pull from your lips for a second before pressing back against the familiar warm embrace.
[22:20] Kire Brownback: he nods and purrs softly, rubbing his head against your neck agreed he softly kisses the back of your soft neck and now we are stuck in space for the rest of time
[22:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A murr vibrates my chest when you bury your face into my neck. “I couldn’t spend the rest of time with anyone better.” I lift your chin up and press my lips passionately into yours for a few long seconds before I pull away from you my eyes locked into your with a look of absolute love and adoration. “I love you so much. I never thought I’d ever have this in my life, that’d I’d ever feel so intensely for another. Thank you so much Kire for being in my life.”
[22:27] Kire Brownback: he smiles neither could I. We have an amazing crew.. his paws travel down your back and an amazing ship with the universe at our finger tips. With out research, we will be able to upgrade our ship to go speeds never thought possible before
[22:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod my paws tracing up and down your thigh as I begin to talk. “Who knows what kind of crazy adventures we will get ourselves into.”
05:56] Kire Brownback: he smirks, his tail wrapping arround your arm they'll all be fun as long as I'm with you
[09:06] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My tail wraps around your inner most thigh  the tip stroking your sheath. “I agree but I do have a question did you want to continue playing?”
[09:14] Kire Brownback: he nods quickly, smirking yes please
[09:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile my paws gently rubbing your sheath. “And did you want my otter ass babe? I know you love it....”
[09:50] Kire Brownback: he giggles, nuzzling your cheek maybe you could take my tight lil' pussy? Grinds on your leg a bit
14:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I stop playing with your sheathe and instead move my paw further down between your legs a digit gently circling around your entrance. “I might be amenable to that, does the little pussy cat want my cock in its ass?”
[14:50] Kire Brownback: he gasps softly, squeezing his cheeks arround your digit y-yes please~
[14:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I pull my finger away and grab my tablet after a few button presses a bottle of ultra slick silicone lube appears on the night stand. I take it and pour a generous amount on my digits before gently rubbing some onto your tail hole a tingling sensation can be felt as I spread more and more into your entrance before I gently press slipping in easily.
[14:55] Kire Brownback: he moans softly, pushing forward onto all fours at the feeling of your paw on my entrance, a look of pleasure on his face with his jaw hanging open slightly(edited)
[14:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I slowly work my finger in and out of your tight ass stopping every few pumps to reapply lube before slipping my finger out completely. I use my lube covered paw to stroke my shaft spreading lube over my smooth shaft before I put my arms on either side of you and mount you doggy style my tip kissing the opening of your ass.
[14:59] Kire Brownback: he pants very softly, pushing back on your tip lightly as his own member starts to rise up and his claws grip the bed sheets
[15:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My tip pushes against your opening adding more and more pressure until with a gasp from me my tip slips in where I freeze. “Fuck Kire you’re so tight babe”
[15:02] Kire Brownback: he let's out a low moan as he gets penetrated, his member twitching slightly as he clenches on your cock n-no.. your just really th-thick
[15:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I moan loudly as you clench on my tip and instinctively push myself fully inside thankfully easily since you were already lubed up.
[15:09] Kire Brownback: he let's out a loud moan, closing his eyes and pushing back on you slightly as his cock drips a few drops of precum onto the bed sheets f-fuck~
[15:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: *I stay still for a few seconds until I slowly pull out to my tip and suddenly pushing back in fully only to pull out nearly all the way before slamming back into you. I keep doing the gently building a rhythm while my paws reach under you to gently massage your sheath and testicles. “mmmmhmmmm~ you’re so good.”
[15:15] Kire Brownback: he moans louder as the rythem builds up, his cock getting as hard as stone and getting close to releasing his seed, causeing him to tense up and clench hard on your cock
[15:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I moan my own cock rock hard inside of you and starting to pulse my hips building up the Rhythm to a frantic pace before I Holy my self inside of you my cock pouring rope after rope after rope  of my sticky hot cum inside of you.
[15:18] Kire Brownback: he releases a loud moan as he gets filled, releasing ropes of cum from his own member onto the bed and his fur
[15:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: It takes nearly a minute for my balls to empty inside of you but my post ejaculation bliss was so intense I stay hilted inside of you my cock slowly deflating letting my cum start to slip out and onto me.
[15:22] Kire Brownback: he is perfectly content with this, his cock slowly starting to hide back in it's sheath th-that.. felt.. amazing...
[15:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “H-hah y-yeah It did fuck..... I’m out of breath...” I gently pull out of you and lay down next to you gently panting my paw patting next to me. “Cmere sexy I want to cuddle.”
[15:25] Kire Brownback: he smiles and lays down next to you, his head resting on your chest, one of his paws rubbing your belly
[15:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I murr softly my paw stroking your cheek as I gaze at you with a happy smile. “I’m way too lucky.”
15:27] Kire Brownback: he nuzzles your neck softly no, just amazingly talented he pulls the sheets over both of us, holding you close as he slowly drifts off
20:54] Kire Brownback: he wiggles a bit under the sheets, setting his head on your neck
[20:59] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My arm slides under your back so I can wrap it around your waist and bring you to me my lips finding yours in the darkness. “Goodnight my love.”
[21:00] Kire Brownback: he is already asleep, purring very softly in your warm and soft embrace
[21:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My eyes flutter shut shortly after you fall asleep the soft purring gently lulling me to sleep.
[21:03] Kire Brownback: his eyes slowly open the next day. feeling your arm arround him, he doesn't move, but begins to very slowly groom his neck fur
21:42] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I wake up after several minutes to find you grooming my neck. I give your waist a squeeze my arm completely asleep causing me to laugh loudly from the tingles. “Kire sit up my arm is asleep!” I manage to say between raucous giggles.
[21:44] Kire Brownback: he giggles and presses down harder on your arm, a massive grin on his face no! Kisses your cheek you shall not get up today!
[21:47] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a fit of laughter my free paw trying to push you off my arm. “AVA turn off artificial gravity!”
[21:48] Kire Brownback: he let's out a fake growl as he slowly floats up Ava, gravity to 1g in our room. They both crash back down on to the bed, kire giggling and grining
[21:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “AVA emergency reset this suites artificial gravity unit Ambrose override!” The gravity shuts off abruptly and I slip out from under you.
[21:56] Kire Brownback: he sighs and gets out of the bed ava, set gravity to 50% of Earth gravity, global ship. The gravity changes back to normal...ish you ok, dear?(edited)
[22:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: You hear an eeep close to our door as the gravity goes to 50% it must have been Jeneanie. “Whoops maybe we should do everything with alarms and 10 second heads up.”
[22:06] Kire Brownback: he chukles and stands up but that would be less fun. He puts his uniform on, smiling
[22:11] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I bound over to our closet and pull my uniform out on my side slipping into it quickly and peek outside our room letting out a laugh when I see the mess in the corridor.
[22:13] Kire Brownback: he frowns as he does a check of everything, then picks up his tablet and begins to design something how does it look out there? Like a disaster area?
[22:17] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “It looks like our resident dragon overcompensated while flying due to her sudden weight change.” I point outside the hall to the dragon currently tripped up in a tangle of her own limbs.(edited)
[22:20] Kire Brownback: he peeks out a let's out a giggle

Jeneanine she notices them and growls if recommend to stop giggling if you don't want me to break your bones 
Kire quickly hides back in his room
[22:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I poke my tongue out at her and likewise follow Kire dipping back into our room.(edited)
[22:22] Kire Brownback: kire giggles I feel like we should actually help her... But wow she is cute like that
[22:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I likewise laugh and slap you in the back “I know what you mean but she’s also a little scary!”
[22:23] Kire Brownback: he nods and smiles true, true. Nuzzles you
[22:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nuzzle you back but pull back away and reach to grab up my tablet. “What’s on the docket today Skipper?” I say with a flirty wink my tail teasingly slapping you on the butt.
[22:26] Kire Brownback: he adds something to the very top of it, hiding the rest of the items. All it says is free jeneanine..  or at least help her get out
[22:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give a crisp salute and make my way to the door. “Do you think we will need protective gear?”
[22:28] Kire Brownback: smirks oven mitts? Snickers
19:45] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I’m not sure oven mitts will do perhaps we should-“ I pause my words as I poke my head out into the hallway after a few seconds poke it back in “The hologram is already helping her.”
19:46] Kire Brownback: he nods and checks that off the list she's gonna kill us when she can puts the rest of the tasks back up
19:50] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “So what else is on the docket for today skipper now that our Hologram has slain the dragon for us?” I say with a giggle giving you a goofy wink. “We really should name our white wolfess though seems strange that she didn’t come with one she’s so life like.”
[19:51] Kire Brownback: he nods hmmm.. how about..  Ingrid? He send a copy of the docket to him isn't that much today
[19:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Well maybe we should ask if she wants to name herself?” I say while shrugging.
[19:55] Kire Brownback: he thinks for a bit, doing a double check of his list go ahead if you want to
[23:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I take my pad and put it into my cargo pants pocket. “I actually have to go into the engineering room and do some check ups why don’t you go ask her unless you need to do something as well.”
[23:25] Kire Brownback: he nods I do need to do an inspection of Ava's electronics. Which is probably gonna take longer then your check ups
[23:26] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Don’t scramble her brain while you’re in there.” I say heading for engineering.
[23:28] Kire Brownback: he nods I have degree in electrical engineering, don't worry he puts on the necessary anti-static gear and heads into the freezing cold room where Ava's circuitry is stored
[23:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: *I let out a chuckle one of us works in the freezing cold the other works in the sweltering heat.
[23:31] Kire Brownback: he goes to the main console, logging in and doing a deep system scan
[23:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The scan comes back clear of any fragmentation all things working optimally
[23:35] Kire Brownback: he smiles Ava, prepare insulation suit 1 with anti static protection he walks out of the room and closes the door, going to put the suit on
[23:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Suit one prepared for you Captain, please be careful in my head.” Her voice is chipper but her last statement seems almost condescending not in a disrespectful way though.
23:42] Kire Brownback: Will do, Ava. He puts the suit on, going back into the room security bypass for main processor, alpha five beta two six four, enter another door opens, hydrogen flowing out and filling the room in a thick cloud\23:46] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The room has no frost but it’s temperatures were at around -20 below the atmoscrubbers making sure to remove any sign of moisture in the air.
[23:48] Kire Brownback: he turns on the light in his helmet, doing a careful visual inspection of the chip Ava, run diagnostics on main processor
[23:53] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Main processor is working within margins and is still hardware locked for only 50% processing power.”
[23:54] Kire Brownback: Got it he turns around and leaves that compartment, closing and resealing that door, then leaving the control room and relsealing it up, taking off the suit he was wearing
27 October 2018
[00:03] Ambrosia fluffbutt: The PA activates throughout the ship and my voice come in clear over it. “Hello and good morning ladies and gentlemen. I know you’ve all been wondering what going faster than light looks like so I have the pleasure of telling you that the airlock windows are not covered.”(edited)
[00:05] Kire Brownback: he chukles, checking somethings off his list. He then goes to his cockpit and begins to do some diagnostics(edited)
[00:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: *several minutes go by silently until you hear the door to the bridge open. “Charlotte.” I say simply leaning against the wall next to the doorway.
[00:15] Kire Brownback: he turns keeps his eyes focused on certain graph with 6 different lines is that what she wants to be called his head is being held up by his paw
[00:16] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Yup... so whatcha doing?” I move so I’m right behind you my paws resting on your shoulders gently rubbing them.
[00:18] Kire Brownback: Diagnosticts is all. This is just a graph of the average core speed over the last 3 days... And it's somewhat concerning that it has a very light downward trend he draws a line on the monitor, pointing out the downward trend of the core speeds(edited)
[00:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “She seems to be doing everything right... also why does it start at 50%” I say lifting a paw from your shoulder to point at the starting point.
[00:21] Kire Brownback: Cause if it was at 100% we would have to replace the chip next year... But this is starting to show that type of slope. Could it be cause of the warp drives? He taps the desk idly
[00:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: ”The drives are zero emission there shouldn’t be any kind of interference we ran a full spectrum analysis on all kinds of emissions electrical, chemical, ultra violet and everything else that there could be.” My face is screwed up in concentration as I think hard on what the issue could be.(edited)
[00:26] Kire Brownback: But what about in a super cooled hydrogen rich environment? Did we do any tests in that? Cause that is how the processor is kept cool he brings up a schematic of the processor's room(edited)
[00:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Again these drives are zero emission there’s nothing that comes off the drive to interact with the hydrogen.”\00:29] Kire Brownback: he sighs then... What could it be? He brings up an electrical diagram of the chip could it be a bad wire? I know it couldn't be any type of RF interference.... Wait... Where is the microwave oven placed?
[00:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I snap my fingers with an I have an idea expression on “We didn’t test the imaging equipment Jeneanie brought aboard there might be microwave emitters in them.”(edited)
[00:34] Kire Brownback: he nods that makes sense. Do we have any microwave insulation in storage we can install quickly? He begins to rapidly type out some notes
[00:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “We’ve got about a 75ft roll I’ll go grab it.”
[00:37] Kire Brownback: Got it. Put it around the medical ward, primarily around the surgical center Types that into the notes as well
[00:38] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and hurry off to the cargo bay to grab the insulation.
[00:40] Kire Brownback: he stands up as well and gets the tools needed to attach the insulation: "space grade" duck tape and scissors
00:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I meet you in the surgical suite carrying the heavy ass roll of insulation with me. “Honey I’m home... oh hey what’s up Jeneanie?” I say awkwardly blushing as I notice her eyeing us with a toothy grin.

J “so why the house call boys? And why the decorations?” Her eyebrow is arched as she takes in the scene around her(edited)
[07:03] Kire Brownback: He sets the roll of duck tape on the ground and pulls out his tablet we've been noticing a faster than usual decline in the clock speeds of Ava's main processor, and belive it maybe due to some microwave emiters in the new equipment you brought in
[08:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She nods and shrugs. “Sorry?”
[08:53] Kire Brownback: shakes his head don't worry. Just gonna be putting up some insulation to stop the microwaves.
[08:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: She smiles then notices the winded Ambrose and pulls the roll out of his grip easily. “Here let me help I think I’m a bit stronger than you.”
[08:57] Kire Brownback: smiles, then pulls out a pencil, marking a spot on the wall this is where the insulation should start. And we may need to insulate the inside of the room as well.
[09:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: Jeneanie begins to unroll the insulation but by bit waiting for you to duck tape behind her as she goes meanwhile I’m standing behind with a spectrometer waiting to see if the microwave radiation starts to die down as you two work
[09:54] Kire Brownback: he tapes up the edge of the insulation to wall keep the insulation pulled tight. Don't want it to look messy he gets onto the ground, laying on his belly and tapeing the bottom of the insulation to the wall
[09:56] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I see my kitty laying in the floor being through as ever and I can’t help but to sneak up behind and give your butt a loud slap. “Feline but firm and secured you’re cleared to tape Kire.” I try to say this in my best impression of of an air traffic controller but a slight snicker escapes me towards the end.
[10:04] Kire Brownback: he gasps and then blushes, then gets an evil grin on his face as he scoots forward, following a bit behind Jen Ambrose, you know we have like 30 50 foots rolls of this tape. And yes I will tape you to the wall with it(edited)
[10:13] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shrug and let my tail slide across your snoot giving it a gentle flick to the nose as it passes. “Hey as long as you bring me food I won’t mind. People used to sleep stuck to walls in space before artificial gravity.”
[10:16] Kire Brownback: he sighs ok, true. But since your stuck to the wall, I can do what ever I want to that tiny cock of yours? 
Jen she blushes can you all please not talk about stuff like that arround me... It's makes me a bit... Weird..
[10:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I raise an eyebrow towards the dragon “Define weird? I’ve never heard of a doctor who gets bashful at the mention of anatomy... especially one who’s already seen me naked in a rejuv tank.”
[10:19] Kire Brownback: she sighs well your cock is tiny... And I tend to prefer big cock or another pussy to play with..
[10:20] Ambrosia fluffbutt: My face blushes bright red. And I bury my face into the spectroscope. “Ermmm ahhh the microwave radiation is decreasing looks like it’s working....”
[10:22] Kire Brownback: Jen and and kire both snicker, then kire stands up and tapes the end of the insulation to the wall can you one of you taps up the top portion for the insulation? Cause im tiny and wall he holds out the role of tape
[10:25] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I grab the roll from your paws and mutter something about “Shorty.... and at least I can reach things.... Mr. Big Dick” He reaches up and begins to tape the top portion up quickly and efficiently.
[10:27] Kire Brownback: he snickers, pulling out his tablet did we ever out in a large matter reconstructer or or did we scrap that idea?
10:33] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I have one in engineering in case we need to make large parts for the drives while in space or a piece of the modular hull armor needs replacing. Why?”
[10:35] Kire Brownback: Just wondering is all. Ava, give me a full chip diagnosis, please.
Ava main processor is optimal. Core clock speeds are decreasing at a slower rate as well.
11:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I step back after finishing the tape job tossing you the roll. “Alright what’s next? Netflix and chill?”
[11:34] Kire Brownback: he  chukles and checks his tablet do you have some gummy candy and big blankets?
12:07] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I shake my head no and stand there with my hands on my hips. “So I’m done with all my stuff are you guys done with your duties for today?”
[12:10] Kire Brownback: kire nods, leaning into Ambrose. Jeneanine nods as well, then says I've mainly just been doing some drawing and sketching... But I don't wanna share it
21:34] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I give a sly smile at Jeneanie  and an equally sly wink. “Your sketch books filled with giant cocks or something?”
[21:37] Kire Brownback: she shakes her head no, more abstract. I'll show you later... If I feel like it. But I need to do some other things for now. She turns around and goes back into her room 
K he smiles back at you well.. wanna cuddle now?(edited)
[21:39] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I look back at the gray furred cat and take his paw in mine. “You know i’d actually really like that, love.”
[21:41] Kire Brownback: he smiles and picks up in his arms, running his tounge along your head fur quickly good. Cause his face turning a sarcasticaly serious I'm gonna cuddle the fuck out of ya head for their room, you still in his arms
[21:52] Ambrosia fluffbutt: (Lol imagining you carrying my much bigger body is amusing.)
[21:53] Kire Brownback: (he is struggling a tiny bit, but he is still managing...  Somehow)
[21:54] Ambrosia fluffbutt: A deep rumble can be felt emanating from my chest as you groom my head. “You’d better Mr.”
[21:56] Kire Brownback: he sets you down on the chest, then pulls out the gifst he got from when they first arrived we never got these out when we first arrived... I think it's time now. Mind helping me?
22:00] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I nod and get up behind you gently holding your hips as you lean to pick up the boxes. “Where do you want to put them?”
[22:02] Kire Brownback: he smiles softly, setting the one with the plate to the side I was thing we could place the plate in the cockpit, and maybe the plushies and each other's night stand or at our desks?
[22:05] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “I want you on my nightstand that way even if I wake up not facing you I wake up to my handsome kitty cat.” I say the last words in a baby voice gently squeezing your hips.
[22:07] Kire Brownback: he giggles, wrapping his tail around your paw, sliding the box with the kitty plushie over to him I'm gonna have yours on my desk. Always nice to have a lil' otter plush to squeeze when I'm stressed
22:18] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile and gently stroke your tail as I put your cute plushie on my desk and step back to gaze at it holding my thumbs at a 90 degree angle and make a click of satisfaction. “Purrrrrrfect”
[22:20] Kire Brownback: he rolls his eyes, setting the box with the plate and otter plush on his night stand, then opening the box with the quilt wow... I don't even wanna take this out of the box cause of how pretty it is...
[22:23] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I move back behind you wrapping my paws around your stomach and peeking over your shoulder to look at the quilt. “It really is... you are way better at giving gifts than me.”
[22:24] Kire Brownback: he murrs softly but it's nice and weighted and comfortable he slowly picks it up and it would be a big waste to just hang it up
[22:27] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “Looks very comfortable I can’t wait to cuddle underneath it with you...” I gently kiss your ear and give it a gentle nip.
[22:29] Kire Brownback: he smiles, pushing his rear into you well then let go and I'll get it out of the box(edited)
[22:30] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I reluctantly let go letting out a miffed huff. “Fiiiiinnnnne hun bun.” I say playing up the dejection in my voice.
22:35] Kire Brownback: he giggles, then sets out the blanket on the bed, the cat thats spooning the otter directly in the middle of the blanket
[22:37] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I let out a giggle and grab you back into my arms giving you a soft kiss in the neck. “How about some cuddles?”
[22:39] Kire Brownback: he purrs, laying down on to the bed and softly pulling with me do you really need it ask?(edited)
[22:43] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I plop down on the bed pressing my butt against your crotch gently grinding it against you doing my best to recreate the image on the quilt. “Mmmmm this quilt is nice and comfy.”
[22:45] Kire Brownback: he purrs softly, pulling you against my body it's even better with you here softly kisses you
[22:48] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I turn around in your arms so we are chest to chest my paws gently running up and down your chest fur gently stroking your soft fur.
“You’re so right it is way better with you here.” My mouth finds yours and I give you a loving smooch my tongue gently probing past your lips to tangle with yours.
[22:49] Kire Brownback: he closes his eyes, purring heavily, then breaking the kiss, smiling wanna do something fun and comfy?
[23:02] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “You said my second and third favorite words.”
[23:04] Kire Brownback: he giggles, then slides you to the side of the bed squeeze up close to me, Hun he then begins to roll both of us up the in the blanke, squeezing us closer together like where in a burrito
[23:08] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I start giggling as you we roll over and over on top of each other until the entire quilt is rolled up around us. Somehow during the rollpocalypse I scooted down away from your face. I gently rest my head on your chest and listen to your heartbeat faintly smiling.
[23:11] Kire Brownback: he purrs more sure you wanna stay there when I make this really nice and tight so you're barely able to move? He then wiggles his arms free from out of the furrito
[23:21] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I kiss your chest and inch my way up back to your face. “Ready Captain!”
[23:21] Kire Brownback: he giggles and wraps us up tighter, so we have just enough room to breath and wiggle a bit
[23:24] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I smile my cheeks ruddy from the body heat and being close to my love. I giggle and start to pepper your cheeks with soft pecks. “You’re so cute...”
[23:27] Kire Brownback: he smiles and accepts the the little pecks I know... But your cuter...
[23:28] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I briefly stop giving you pecks and give you a blep face my tongue tickling the tip of your nose due to the limited space. “Shush how about we leave it at we are both adorable.”
[23:29] Kire Brownback: he smiles and laughes at the nose licks fine, fine he yawns
[23:32] Ambrosia fluffbutt: *I look up at you with an unreadable expression. “Tired already?”
[23:34] Kire Brownback: he nods yeah... Kinda wiggles a bit, mumbling something about "wireless... Plug... Cum..."(edited)
[23:35] Ambrosia fluffbutt: “W-What was that?” I ask leaning in to try to parse out your crazed mumblings.
[23:37] Kire Brownback: he blushes a bit I... Kinda wanted to put a wireless plug..  up your butt... Then he says quickly cause I want constant control over you
[23:51] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I blush and kiss your cheek getting close to your ear. “It better be a big one then, love~” I practically purr into your ear.
[23:53] Kire Brownback: he nods I have it ready... But I'm dong really wanna unwrap us.. he yawns again I'm also getting pretty sleepy..
[23:55] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I kiss your lips and snuggle further into your body my tail wrapping around your thinner slender tail. “Why don’t we nap first?”
[23:56] Kire Brownback: he nods that sound like a yawns again goood idea.. he closes his eyes and quickly falls asleep
[23:57] Ambrosia fluffbutt: I wiggle and manage to get my arms around your back and I squeeze you quickly following you into sleep.
